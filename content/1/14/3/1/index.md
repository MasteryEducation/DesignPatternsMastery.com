### Real-World Examples of Architectural Decisions

To illustrate the concepts discussed, let's examine some architectural decisions in well-known systems.

#### Example 1: Netflix

Netflix is renowned for its microservices architecture, which allows it to scale efficiently and deploy changes rapidly. The decision to adopt microservices was driven by the need for scalability and flexibility, enabling different teams to work independently on various components of the system.

#### Example 2: Amazon

Amazon's architecture focuses on scalability and high availability. By using distributed systems and cloud computing, Amazon can handle massive traffic and ensure reliability. Their architecture is designed to support rapid growth and continuous deployment.

#### Example 3: Google Search

Google's search architecture emphasizes speed and accuracy. Through the use of distributed computing and advanced algorithms, Google can process vast amounts of data quickly and deliver relevant search results.

### Encouraging a Holistic Understanding

A successful software architect must consider both technical and non-technical factors in system design. Here are some key aspects to keep in mind.

#### Technical Considerations

1. **System Performance:**
   - Ensure that the system can handle the expected load and perform efficiently.

2. **Security:**
   - Design systems with security in mind, protecting data and preventing unauthorized access.

3. **Integration:**
   - Consider how different components will integrate and communicate with each other.

#### Non-Technical Considerations

1. **User Experience:**
   - Design systems that are intuitive and easy to use, enhancing the overall user experience.

2. **Cost:**
