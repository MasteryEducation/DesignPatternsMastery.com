## 13.3.2 Utilizing Observer and Mediator Patterns

In the realm of software design, creating a robust and scalable chat application requires a nuanced understanding of design patterns that facilitate real-time communication and efficient message routing. In this section, we delve into the implementation of the **Observer** and **Mediator** patterns, which are instrumental in managing real-time updates and complex communications in a chat application. We will explore how these patterns can be effectively utilized on both the server and client sides, leveraging WebSockets for seamless two-way communication.

### Implementing Real-Time Updates Using the Observer Pattern

The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object, known as the subject, to maintain a list of its dependents, called observers, and notify them automatically of any state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple components need to react to changes in another component, such as in a chat application where clients need to be updated with new messages in real-time.

#### Server-Side Implementation

On the server side, the chat server acts as the **subject**, while the clients are the **observers**. Here's how you can implement this pattern to manage message updates:

1. **Define the Subject Interface:**

   The subject interface will include methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers.

   ```python
   class Subject:
       def __init__(self):
           self._observers = []

       def attach(self, observer):
           if observer not in self._observers:
               self._observers.append(observer)

       def detach(self, observer):
           try:
               self._observers.remove(observer)
           except ValueError:
               pass

       def notify(self, message):
           for observer in self._observers:
               observer.update(message)
   ```

2. **Implement the Concrete Subject (Chat Server):**

   The chat server will extend the subject and manage the list of connected clients.

   ```python
   class ChatServer(Subject):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()

       def receive_message(self, message):
           print(f"Received message: {message}")
           self.notify(message)
   ```

3. **Define the Observer Interface:**

   Observers implement an `update` method to handle notifications.

   ```python
   class Observer:
       def update(self, message):
           raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses should implement this method.")
   ```

4. **Implement the Concrete Observer (Client):**

   Each client will implement the observer interface to receive updates.

   ```python
   class ChatClient(Observer):
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def update(self, message):
           print(f"{self.name} received: {message}")
   ```

5. **Simulate the Server-Client Interaction:**

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       server = ChatServer()

       alice = ChatClient("Alice")
       bob = ChatClient("Bob")

       server.attach(alice)
       server.attach(bob)

       server.receive_message("Hello, everyone!")
   ```

   In this example, when the server receives a message, it notifies all attached clients (observers).

#### Client-Side Implementation

On the client side, the Observer pattern is used to update the user interface in response to new messages. This involves handling incoming messages and updating the UI accordingly.

1. **WebSocket Client Setup:**

   Using JavaScript, we can establish a WebSocket connection to the server.

   ```javascript
   const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

   socket.onmessage = function(event) {
       const message = event.data;
       updateChatUI(message);
   };

   function updateChatUI(message) {
       const chatBox = document.getElementById('chat-box');
       const newMessage = document.createElement('div');
       newMessage.textContent = message;
       chatBox.appendChild(newMessage);
   }
   ```

   Here, the `onmessage` event listener acts as the observer, updating the chat UI whenever a new message is received from the server.

### Using Mediator to Manage Complex Communications

The **Mediator Pattern** is another behavioral design pattern that centralizes communication between components, reducing the direct dependencies between them. This pattern is particularly useful in chat applications to manage message routing in group chats, handle user interactions like joining or leaving rooms, and broadcast messages efficiently.

#### Mediator Pattern Overview

The Mediator pattern involves a central mediator object that facilitates communication between different components, ensuring that they do not communicate directly with each other. This helps in reducing the coupling between components and makes the system easier to maintain and extend.

1. **Define the Mediator Interface:**

   The mediator interface defines methods for communication between components.

   ```python
   class Mediator:
       def notify(self, sender, event):
           pass
   ```

2. **Implement the Concrete Mediator (Chat Room):**

   The chat room acts as the mediator, managing message routing and user interactions.

   ```python
   class ChatRoom(Mediator):
       def __init__(self):
           self.participants = {}

       def register(self, participant):
           self.participants[participant.name] = participant
           participant.chat_room = self

       def notify(self, sender, message):
           for name, participant in self.participants.items():
               if participant.name != sender:
                   participant.receive(message)
   ```

3. **Define the Participant Interface:**

   Participants interact with the mediator to send and receive messages.

   ```python
   class Participant:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name
           self.chat_room = None

       def send(self, message):
           if self.chat_room:
               self.chat_room.notify(self.name, message)

       def receive(self, message):
           print(f"{self.name} received: {message}")
   ```

4. **Simulate the Chat Room Interaction:**

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       chat_room = ChatRoom()

       alice = Participant("Alice")
       bob = Participant("Bob")

       chat_room.register(alice)
       chat_room.register(bob)

       alice.send("Hello, Bob!")
       bob.send("Hi, Alice!")
   ```

   In this example, the chat room manages the communication between participants, ensuring that messages are routed correctly without direct communication between participants.

### Providing Code Examples with WebSockets

WebSockets enable real-time, two-way communication between the client and server, making them ideal for chat applications where low latency and efficient message exchange are crucial.

#### WebSockets Introduction

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time data transfer between the client and server. This is particularly useful for applications like chat, where timely updates are essential.

#### Python Example Using `aiohttp`

1. **Server-Side Implementation:**

   ```python
   from aiohttp import web

   async def websocket_handler(request):
       ws = web.WebSocketResponse()
       await ws.prepare(request)

       async for msg in ws:
           if msg.type == web.WSMsgType.TEXT:
               await ws.send_str(f"Server: {msg.data}")

       return ws

   app = web.Application()
   app.router.add_get('/ws', websocket_handler)

   web.run_app(app, port=8080)
   ```

2. **Client-Side Implementation:**

   ```javascript
   const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws');

   socket.onopen = function() {
       console.log("Connected to server");
       socket.send("Hello, server!");
   };

   socket.onmessage = function(event) {
       console.log("Received from server: " + event.data);
   };
   ```

#### JavaScript Example Using Node.js and `ws`

1. **Server-Side Implementation:**

   ```javascript
   const WebSocket = require('ws');

   const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

   wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
       ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
           console.log('received: %s', message);
           ws.send(`Server: ${message}`);
       });
   });
   ```

2. **Client-Side Implementation:**

   ```javascript
   const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

   socket.onopen = function() {
       console.log("Connected to server");
       socket.send("Hello, server!");
   };

   socket.onmessage = function(event) {
       console.log("Received from server: " + event.data);
   };
   ```

### Real-World Applications and Best Practices

By utilizing the Observer and Mediator patterns alongside WebSockets, developers can create scalable and efficient chat applications capable of handling real-time communication with ease. Here are some best practices to consider:

- **Decouple Components:** Use the Mediator pattern to reduce direct dependencies between components, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
