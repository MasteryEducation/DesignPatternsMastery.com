## 4.4.1 Visualizing Creational Patterns

Understanding creational design patterns is crucial for any software developer aiming to create scalable and maintainable systems. These patterns focus on the best ways to create objects, which is a fundamental aspect of software design. In this section, we will delve into how to represent these patterns using Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. UML is a powerful tool that helps visualize the architecture of software systems, making it easier to understand and implement design patterns.

### Introduction to Creational Patterns

Creational patterns abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. The key creational patterns we will explore include:

- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### The Role of UML in Visualizing Patterns

UML diagrams serve as a blueprint for software systems. They help in visualizing the structure and behavior of a system, which is essential when dealing with complex design patterns. By using class diagrams, we can represent the static structure of the system, showing the classes involved and their relationships. Sequence diagrams, on the other hand, help us understand the dynamic behavior, illustrating how objects interact in a particular scenario.

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

#### UML Class Diagram for Singleton

In the Singleton pattern, the class diagram highlights the static instance and the private constructor, ensuring that the class cannot be instantiated from outside.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Singleton {
    -static instance : Singleton
    -Singleton()
    +getInstance() : Singleton
  }
```

#### Code Example: Singleton in Python

```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

singleton1 = Singleton()
singleton2 = Singleton()
print(singleton1 is singleton2)  # Output: True
```

In this Python example, the `__new__` method ensures that only one instance of the class is created. The `is` operator confirms that both `singleton1` and `singleton2` refer to the same instance.

### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.

#### UML Class Diagram for Factory Method

The class diagram for the Factory Method pattern shows the Creator class and its subclasses, the ConcreteCreators. Each ConcreteCreator overrides the factory method to produce an instance of a ConcreteProduct.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Product {
  }

  class ConcreteProductA {
  }

  class ConcreteProductB {
  }

  class Creator {
      +factoryMethod() : Product
  }

  class ConcreteCreatorA {
      +factoryMethod() : Product
  }

  class ConcreteCreatorB {
      +factoryMethod() : Product
  }

  Product <|-- ConcreteProductA
  Product <|-- ConcreteProductB
  Creator <|-- ConcreteCreatorA
  Creator <|-- ConcreteCreatorB
  Creator o--> Product
```

#### Code Example: Factory Method in JavaScript

```javascript
class Product {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class ConcreteProductA extends Product {
  constructor() {
    super('ConcreteProductA');
  }
}

class ConcreteProductB extends Product {
  constructor() {
    super('ConcreteProductB');
  }
}

class Creator {
  factoryMethod() {
    return new Product('DefaultProduct');
  }
}

class ConcreteCreatorA extends Creator {
  factoryMethod() {
    return new ConcreteProductA();
  }
}

class ConcreteCreatorB extends Creator {
  factoryMethod() {
    return new ConcreteProductB();
  }
}

// Usage
const creatorA = new ConcreteCreatorA();
const productA = creatorA.factoryMethod();
console.log(productA.name); // Output: ConcreteProductA

const creatorB = new ConcreteCreatorB();
const productB = creatorB.factoryMethod();
console.log(productB.name); // Output: ConcreteProductB
```

In this JavaScript example, the `ConcreteCreatorA` and `ConcreteCreatorB` classes override the `factoryMethod` to instantiate and return specific products.

### Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful when a system needs to be independent of how its products are created.

#### UML Class Diagram for Abstract Factory

The class diagram illustrates the AbstractFactory interface and its ConcreteFactories, each responsible for creating a family of related products.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class AbstractFactory {
      +createProductA() : AbstractProductA
      +createProductB() : AbstractProductB
  }

  class ConcreteFactory1 {
      +createProductA() : ProductA1
      +createProductB() : ProductB1
  }

  class ConcreteFactory2 {
      +createProductA() : ProductA2
      +createProductB() : ProductB2
  }

  class AbstractProductA {
  }

  class AbstractProductB {
  }

  class ProductA1 {
  }

  class ProductA2 {
  }

  class ProductB1 {
  }

  class ProductB2 {
  }

  AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory1
  AbstractFactory <|-- ConcreteFactory2
  AbstractProductA <|-- ProductA1
  AbstractProductA <|-- ProductA2
  AbstractProductB <|-- ProductB1
  AbstractProductB <|-- ProductB2
  ConcreteFactory1 o--> ProductA1
  ConcreteFactory1 o--> ProductB1
  ConcreteFactory2 o--> ProductA2
  ConcreteFactory2 o--> ProductB2
```

#### Code Example: Abstract Factory in Python

```python
class AbstractFactory:
    def create_product_a(self):
        pass

    def create_product_b(self):
        pass

class ConcreteFactory1(AbstractFactory):
    def create_product_a(self):
        return ProductA1()

    def create_product_b(self):
        return ProductB1()

class ConcreteFactory2(AbstractFactory):
    def create_product_a(self):
        return ProductA2()

    def create_product_b(self):
        return ProductB2()

class AbstractProductA:
    pass

class AbstractProductB:
    pass

class ProductA1(AbstractProductA):
    pass

class ProductA2(AbstractProductA):
    pass

class ProductB1(AbstractProductB):
    pass

class ProductB2(AbstractProductB):
    pass

factory1 = ConcreteFactory1()
product_a1 = factory1.create_product_a()
product_b1 = factory1.create_product_b()

factory2 = ConcreteFactory2()
product_a2 = factory2.create_product_a()
product_b2 = factory2.create_product_b()
```

In this Python example, `ConcreteFactory1` and `ConcreteFactory2` implement the `AbstractFactory` interface to create products from two different product families.

### Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

#### UML Class Diagram for Builder

The class diagram shows the Builder interface and its ConcreteBuilders, each responsible for constructing and assembling parts of the product.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Builder {
      +buildPartA() : void
      +buildPartB() : void
      +getResult() : Product
  }

  class ConcreteBuilder1 {
      +buildPartA() : void
      +buildPartB() : void
      +getResult() : Product
  }

  class ConcreteBuilder2 {
      +buildPartA() : void
      +buildPartB() : void
      +getResult() : Product
  }

  class Director {
      +construct() : void
  }

  class Product {
  }

  Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder1
  Builder <|-- ConcreteBuilder2
  Director o--> Builder
  ConcreteBuilder1 o--> Product
  ConcreteBuilder2 o--> Product
```

#### Code Example: Builder in JavaScript

```javascript
class Product {
  constructor() {
    this.parts = [];
  }

  addPart(part) {
    this.parts.push(part);
  }

  show() {
    console.log('Product parts: ' + this.parts.join(', '));
  }
}

class Builder {
  buildPartA() {}
  buildPartB() {}
  getResult() {}
}

class ConcreteBuilder1 extends Builder {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.product = new Product();
  }

  buildPartA() {
    this.product.addPart('PartA1');
  }

  buildPartB() {
    this.product.addPart('PartB1');
  }

  getResult() {
    return this.product;
  }
}

class ConcreteBuilder2 extends Builder {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.product = new Product();
  }

  buildPartA() {
    this.product.addPart('PartA2');
  }

  buildPartB() {
    this.product.addPart('PartB2');
  }

  getResult() {
    return this.product;
  }
}

class Director {
  construct(builder) {
    builder.buildPartA();
    builder.buildPartB();
  }
}

// Usage
const director = new Director();
const builder1 = new ConcreteBuilder1();
director.construct(builder1);
const product1 = builder1.getResult();
product1.show(); // Output: Product parts: PartA1, PartB1

const builder2 = new ConcreteBuilder2();
director.construct(builder2);
const product2 = builder2.getResult();
product2.show(); // Output: Product parts: PartA2, PartB2
```

In this JavaScript example, the `Director` class uses the `Builder` interface to construct a product by delegating the building process to `ConcreteBuilder1` and `ConcreteBuilder2`.

### Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern is used to create a new object by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning.

#### UML Class Diagram for Prototype

The class diagram illustrates the Prototype interface and its ConcretePrototypes, each capable of cloning itself.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Prototype {
      +clone() : Prototype
  }

  class ConcretePrototype1 {
      +clone() : ConcretePrototype1
  }

  class ConcretePrototype2 {
      +clone() : ConcretePrototype2
  }

  Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype1
  Prototype <|-- ConcretePrototype2
```

#### Code Example: Prototype in Python

```python
import copy

class Prototype:
    def clone(self):
        pass

class ConcretePrototype1(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

class ConcretePrototype2(Prototype):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def clone(self):
        return copy.deepcopy(self)

prototype1 = ConcretePrototype1('Value1')
clone1 = prototype1.clone()
print(clone1.value)  # Output: Value1

prototype2 = ConcretePrototype2('Value2')
clone2 = prototype2.clone()
print(clone2.value)  # Output: Value2
```

In this Python example, the `clone` method uses `deepcopy` to create a new instance of the object with the same state as the original.
