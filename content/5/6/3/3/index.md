## 6.3.3 Memento Pattern in TypeScript

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement undo/redo functionality, state history management, or simply preserve the state of an object at a given point in time.

In this section, we will explore how to implement the Memento Pattern in TypeScript, leveraging its powerful type system and access modifiers to ensure encapsulation and type safety. We'll cover practical examples, discuss challenges such as handling non-serializable objects, and provide strategies for testing and maintaining Mementos.

### Understanding the Memento Pattern

Before diving into TypeScript-specific implementations, let's briefly recap the core components of the Memento Pattern:

- **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
- **Memento**: A snapshot of the Originator's state. It is an opaque object that should not expose its internal structure.
- **Caretaker**: Manages the Mementos, typically storing and restoring them without accessing their content.

The Memento Pattern ensures that the internal state of an object is preserved without violating encapsulation, allowing the Originator to manage its state privately while providing a mechanism to save and restore it.

### Implementing the Memento Pattern in TypeScript

TypeScript offers several features that make implementing the Memento Pattern both robust and intuitive. Let's explore these features and how they can be applied.

#### Using TypeScript's Access Modifiers for Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a key principle in the Memento Pattern, ensuring that the internal state of the Originator is not exposed. TypeScript's access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, and `public`) are instrumental in enforcing this encapsulation.

```typescript
class Memento {
    private state: string;

    constructor(state: string) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    getState(): string {
        return this.state;
    }
}

class Originator {
    private state: string;

    setState(state: string): void {
        console.log(`Setting state to ${state}`);
        this.state = state;
    }

    saveStateToMemento(): Memento {
        console.log(`Saving state to Memento: ${this.state}`);
        return new Memento(this.state);
    }

    restoreStateFromMemento(memento: Memento): void {
        this.state = memento.getState();
        console.log(`State restored from Memento: ${this.state}`);
    }
}

class Caretaker {
    private mementoList: Memento[] = [];

    add(memento: Memento): void {
        this.mementoList.push(memento);
    }

    get(index: number): Memento {
        return this.mementoList[index];
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Memento` class encapsulates the state using a private modifier, ensuring that the state cannot be modified directly from outside the class. The `Originator` class manages its state and interacts with the `Memento` class to save and restore its state.

#### Defining Memento Interfaces or Classes

Defining interfaces for Mementos can enhance flexibility and enforce contracts between the Originator and Caretaker. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex state objects.

```typescript
interface MementoInterface {
    getState(): string;
}

class ConcreteMemento implements MementoInterface {
    private state: string;

    constructor(state: string) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    getState(): string {
        return this.state;
    }
}
```

By defining a `MementoInterface`, we can ensure that any class implementing this interface will provide the necessary methods to interact with the state.

#### Typing the State within Mementos

Typing the state within Mementos is crucial for ensuring compatibility during restoration. TypeScript's type system allows us to define the shape of the state, providing compile-time checks and reducing runtime errors.

```typescript
interface State {
    value: string;
    timestamp: Date;
}

class TypedMemento {
    private state: State;

    constructor(state: State) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    getState(): State {
        return this.state;
    }
}

class TypedOriginator {
    private state: State;

    setState(state: State): void {
        console.log(`Setting state to ${JSON.stringify(state)}`);
        this.state = state;
    }

    saveStateToMemento(): TypedMemento {
        console.log(`Saving state to Memento: ${JSON.stringify(this.state)}`);
        return new TypedMemento(this.state);
    }

    restoreStateFromMemento(memento: TypedMemento): void {
        this.state = memento.getState();
        console.log(`State restored from Memento: ${JSON.stringify(this.state)}`);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `State` interface defines the structure of the state, ensuring that any state object adheres to this structure.

#### Preventing Unauthorized Access to Memento Internals

TypeScript's access modifiers help prevent unauthorized access to Memento internals. By marking state properties as private, we can ensure that only the Memento itself can modify its state.

#### Handling Non-Serializable Objects

State often includes non-serializable objects, such as functions or DOM elements. To handle such cases, consider strategies like:

- **Serialization Hooks**: Implement custom serialization methods to convert non-serializable objects into a serializable format.
- **Exclusion**: Exclude non-essential non-serializable objects from the state.

```typescript
interface SerializableState {
    value: string;
    metadata?: string;
}

class SerializableMemento {
    private state: SerializableState;

    constructor(state: SerializableState) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    getState(): SerializableState {
        return this.state;
    }
}

class SerializableOriginator {
    private state: SerializableState;

    setState(state: SerializableState): void {
        console.log(`Setting state to ${JSON.stringify(state)}`);
        this.state = state;
    }

    saveStateToMemento(): SerializableMemento {
        console.log(`Saving state to Memento: ${JSON.stringify(this.state)}`);
        return new SerializableMemento(this.state);
    }

    restoreStateFromMemento(memento: SerializableMemento): void {
        this.state = memento.getState();
        console.log(`State restored from Memento: ${JSON.stringify(this.state)}`);
    }
}
```

#### Integrating with TypeScript's JSON Serialization Features

TypeScript can leverage JavaScript's JSON serialization features to manage state. Use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` to serialize and deserialize state objects, ensuring that only serializable properties are included.

```typescript
class JSONMemento {
    private state: string;

    constructor(state: string) {
        this.state = JSON.stringify(state);
    }

    getState(): string {
        return JSON.parse(this.state);
    }
}
```

#### Implications of Type Changes on Stored Mementos

Type changes can have significant implications on stored Mementos. Consider implementing versioning strategies to manage changes over time:

- **Schema Versioning**: Include a version number in your state schema to track changes.
- **Migration Scripts**: Implement scripts to migrate old Mementos to the new schema.

```typescript
interface VersionedState {
    version: number;
    value: string;
}

class VersionedMemento {
    private state: VersionedState;

    constructor(state: VersionedState) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    getState(): VersionedState {
        return this.state;
    }
}
```

#### Using Generics for Flexible Memento Implementations

Generics in TypeScript allow us to create flexible Memento implementations that can handle various state types.

```typescript
class GenericMemento<T> {
    private state: T;

    constructor(state: T) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    getState(): T {
        return this.state;
    }
}

class GenericOriginator<T> {
    private state: T;

    setState(state: T): void {
        console.log(`Setting state to ${JSON.stringify(state)}`);
        this.state = state;
    }

    saveStateToMemento(): GenericMemento<T> {
        console.log(`Saving state to Memento: ${JSON.stringify(this.state)}`);
        return new GenericMemento(this.state);
    }

    restoreStateFromMemento(memento: GenericMemento<T>): void {
        this.state = memento.getState();
        console.log(`State restored from Memento: ${JSON.stringify(this.state)}`);
    }
}
```

#### Testing Strategies in TypeScript

Testing Memento implementations in TypeScript involves verifying that state is correctly saved and restored. Consider using type assertions and mocking frameworks to simulate various scenarios.

- **Type Assertions**: Ensure that the state conforms to expected types.
- **Mocking**: Use mocking libraries to simulate the Originator and Caretaker interactions.

```typescript
import { expect } from 'chai';

describe('Memento Pattern', () => {
    it('should save and restore state', () => {
        const originator = new Originator();
        originator.setState('State1');
        const memento = originator.saveStateToMemento();

        originator.setState('State2');
        originator.restoreStateFromMemento(memento);

        expect(originator.getState()).to.equal('State1');
    });
});
```

#### Considerations for Thread Safety

In environments with concurrency, consider thread safety when implementing the Memento Pattern. Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that state changes are atomic and consistent.

### Practical Applications and Real-World Scenarios

The Memento Pattern is widely used in applications requiring state management, such as:

- **Text Editors**: Implementing undo/redo functionality.
- **Game Development**: Saving and loading game states.
- **Form Management**: Preserving user input during navigation.

### Conclusion

The Memento Pattern is a powerful tool for managing object state in TypeScript applications. By leveraging TypeScript's type system and access modifiers, we can implement robust and flexible Memento solutions that ensure encapsulation and type safety. Whether you're building a simple undo feature or managing complex state histories, the Memento Pattern provides a structured approach to state management.
