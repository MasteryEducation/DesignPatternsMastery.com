## 4.3.2 Implementing Command Interfaces

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of methods with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests. It also provides support for undoable operations. In this section, we will delve into the implementation of Command interfaces in Java, providing a comprehensive guide to creating, managing, and utilizing commands effectively.

### Defining the Command Interface

At the heart of the Command Pattern is the `Command` interface, which typically declares a single method, `execute`. This method encapsulates the action to be performed.

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}
```

The `Command` interface acts as a contract for all command classes, ensuring they implement the `execute` method. This method will be called to perform the desired action.

### Implementing Concrete Command Classes

Concrete command classes implement the `Command` interface and define specific actions. Each command class is associated with a receiver object, which performs the actual work.

```java
public class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}
```

In the example above, `LightOnCommand` is a concrete command that turns on a light. It holds a reference to a `Light` object, the receiver, and calls its `turnOn` method when executed.

### The Role of the Receiver

The receiver is the component that performs the actual work when a command is executed. It contains the business logic related to the command.

```java
public class Light {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("The light is on.");
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("The light is off.");
    }
}
```

The `Light` class in this example is the receiver, providing methods to turn the light on and off.

### Passing Parameters to Commands

Commands often need parameters to perform their actions. These can be passed through constructors or setters.

```java
public class VolumeUpCommand implements Command {
    private Stereo stereo;
    private int level;

    public VolumeUpCommand(Stereo stereo, int level) {
        this.stereo = stereo;
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        stereo.setVolume(level);
    }
}
```

Here, the `VolumeUpCommand` takes a `Stereo` object and a volume level as parameters, adjusting the stereo's volume when executed.

### Invoker Classes

Invoker classes are responsible for initiating commands. They hold references to command objects and call their `execute` methods.

```java
public class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

The `RemoteControl` class acts as an invoker, allowing clients to set a command and execute it by pressing a button.

### Storing, Logging, and Queuing Commands

Commands can be stored, logged, or queued for later execution. This capability is particularly useful for implementing features like undo and redo.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class CommandHistory {
    private Stack<Command> history = new Stack<>();

    public void push(Command command) {
        history.push(command);
    }

    public Command pop() {
        return history.pop();
    }
}
```

The `CommandHistory` class uses a stack to store executed commands, enabling undo functionality by popping commands off the stack.

### Implementing Undo Functionality

To implement undo functionality, commands can define an `undo` method. This method reverses the action performed by `execute`.

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}

public class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOffCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOff();
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}
```

The `LightOffCommand` class implements the `undo` method, turning the light back on when called.

### Command Parameterization and Result Handling

Commands can be parameterized to handle different scenarios and return results. Consider using generics or callbacks for result handling.

```java
public interface Command<T> {
    T execute();
}
```

This generic `Command` interface allows commands to return results of type `T`.

### Exception Handling in Command Execution

Handling exceptions within command execution is crucial for robustness. Commands should catch and handle exceptions internally or propagate them to the invoker.

```java
public class SafeCommand implements Command {
    private Command command;

    public SafeCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        try {
            command.execute();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Command execution failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

The `SafeCommand` class wraps another command and handles exceptions during execution.

### Best Practices for Command Classes

- **Naming and Organization**: Use descriptive names for command classes to indicate their purpose. Organize them in packages based on functionality.
- **Cohesion and Focus**: Design commands to be cohesive and focused on a single action. Avoid combining multiple actions in a single command.
- **Testing Strategies**: Test individual commands and their interactions with receivers. Use mock objects to isolate command behavior during testing.

### Serializing Commands

Commands can be serialized for distributed systems or persistence. Ensure command classes implement `Serializable` and handle any transient fields appropriately.

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class SerializableCommand implements Command, Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private transient Receiver receiver;

    // Constructor, execute, undo methods...
}
```

### Conclusion

The Command Pattern provides a flexible and powerful way to encapsulate actions as objects. By implementing command interfaces, you can create reusable, composable, and easily managed commands that enhance the robustness of your Java applications. Whether you're building a simple remote control or a complex task scheduler, the Command Pattern offers a structured approach to managing actions and their execution.
