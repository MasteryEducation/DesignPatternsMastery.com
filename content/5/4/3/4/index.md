## 4.3.4 Example: Remote Control Commands

In this section, we will delve into a practical application of the Command pattern by implementing a universal remote control system in Java. This example will illustrate the power of the Command pattern in decoupling the invocation of operations from the objects that perform them, offering flexibility and extensibility in design.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to issue requests to objects without knowing anything about the operation being requested or the receiver of the request.

### Designing the Universal Remote Control System

Our goal is to create a universal remote control system capable of managing various devices such as lights and TVs. Each device can perform multiple actions, such as turning on or off. We'll use the Command pattern to encapsulate these actions.

### Defining the Command Interface

The core of the Command pattern is the `Command` interface. This interface will declare two essential methods: `execute` and `undo`.

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
```

### Implementing Concrete Commands

For each action that a device can perform, we will create a concrete command class. Let's consider a `Light` and a `TV` as our devices.

#### Light Commands

```java
// Receiver class
public class Light {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("The light is on.");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("The light is off.");
    }
}

// Concrete Command for turning the light on
public class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        light.off();
    }
}

// Concrete Command for turning the light off
public class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOffCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        light.off();
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        light.on();
    }
}
```

#### TV Commands

```java
// Receiver class
public class TV {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("The TV is on.");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("The TV is off.");
    }
}

// Concrete Command for turning the TV on
public class TVOnCommand implements Command {
    private TV tv;

    public TVOnCommand(TV tv) {
        this.tv = tv;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        tv.on();
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        tv.off();
    }
}

// Concrete Command for turning the TV off
public class TVOffCommand implements Command {
    private TV tv;

    public TVOffCommand(TV tv) {
        this.tv = tv;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        tv.off();
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        tv.on();
    }
}
```

### Creating the Invoker: The Remote Control

The `Invoker` in our system is the remote control, which will hold slots for commands. Each button on the remote is associated with a command.

```java
public class RemoteControl {
    private Command[] onCommands;
    private Command[] offCommands;
    private Command undoCommand;

    public RemoteControl() {
        onCommands = new Command[7];
        offCommands = new Command[7];

        Command noCommand = new NoCommand();
        for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
            onCommands[i] = noCommand;
            offCommands[i] = noCommand;
        }
        undoCommand = noCommand;
    }

    public void setCommand(int slot, Command onCommand, Command offCommand) {
        onCommands[slot] = onCommand;
        offCommands[slot] = offCommand;
    }

    public void onButtonWasPushed(int slot) {
        onCommands[slot].execute();
        undoCommand = onCommands[slot];
    }

    public void offButtonWasPushed(int slot) {
        offCommands[slot].execute();
        undoCommand = offCommands[slot];
    }

    public void undoButtonWasPushed() {
        undoCommand.undo();
    }
}
```

### Mapping Commands to Remote Control Buttons

Commands are assigned to buttons on the remote control, allowing users to execute or undo actions.

```java
public class RemoteControlTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();

        Light livingRoomLight = new Light();
        TV livingRoomTV = new TV();

        LightOnCommand livingRoomLightOn = new LightOnCommand(livingRoomLight);
        LightOffCommand livingRoomLightOff = new LightOffCommand(livingRoomLight);

        TVOnCommand livingRoomTVOn = new TVOnCommand(livingRoomTV);
        TVOffCommand livingRoomTVOff = new TVOffCommand(livingRoomTV);

        remote.setCommand(0, livingRoomLightOn, livingRoomLightOff);
        remote.setCommand(1, livingRoomTVOn, livingRoomTVOff);

        System.out.println("Turning on the living room light:");
        remote.onButtonWasPushed(0);
        System.out.println("Turning off the living room light:");
        remote.offButtonWasPushed(0);
        System.out.println("Undoing the last command:");
        remote.undoButtonWasPushed();

        System.out.println("Turning on the living room TV:");
        remote.onButtonWasPushed(1);
        System.out.println("Turning off the living room TV:");
        remote.offButtonWasPushed(1);
        System.out.println("Undoing the last command:");
        remote.undoButtonWasPushed();
    }
}
```

### Flexibility and Extensibility

The Command pattern provides significant flexibility. Commands can be reassigned to different buttons at runtime, allowing for dynamic configuration of the remote control. This decouples the remote's interface from the specific implementations of the devices, making it easy to add new devices or change existing ones without altering the remote's code.

### Handling No-Operations and Default Commands

A common practice is to implement a `NoCommand` class that does nothing, which can be used to initialize command slots in the remote control. This avoids null checks and simplifies the code logic.

```java
public class NoCommand implements Command {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        // Do nothing
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        // Do nothing
    }
}
```

### Extending the System with Macro Commands

The system can be extended to support macro commands, which execute multiple actions. A `MacroCommand` class can hold a list of commands and execute them in sequence.

```java
public class MacroCommand implements Command {
    private Command[] commands;

    public MacroCommand(Command[] commands) {
        this.commands = commands;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        for (Command command : commands) {
            command.execute();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        for (int i = commands.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            commands[i].undo();
        }
    }
}
```

### Managing State and Consistency

When implementing a command system, it's crucial to manage the state of devices to ensure consistent behavior. Each command should accurately reflect the current state of the device, and undo operations should reliably revert to the previous state.

### Scalability Considerations

As more devices and commands are added, the system remains scalable due to the decoupled nature of the Command pattern. New devices can be integrated by simply creating new command classes without modifying the existing infrastructure.

### Testing Strategies

Testing the command execution flow involves verifying that each command correctly interacts with its receiver and that the undo functionality works as expected. Unit tests can be written for each command to ensure they perform the correct actions.

### Real-World Advantages of the Command Pattern

This example demonstrates the Command pattern's ability to decouple the invocation of operations from the details of the operations themselves. This decoupling allows for flexible command assignment, easy integration of new devices, and robust undo functionality, making it a powerful pattern for real-world applications such as remote control systems.
