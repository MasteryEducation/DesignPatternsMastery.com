## 4.3.3 Undo and Redo Operations

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, and supports undoable operations. In this section, we will delve into how the Command pattern facilitates implementing undo and redo functionality, a critical feature in many applications such as text editors, graphics software, and transactional systems.

### Facilitating Undo and Redo with the Command Pattern

The Command pattern is particularly well-suited for implementing undo and redo operations because it encapsulates all the details of an action within a command object. By storing these command objects, we can easily reverse or reapply actions, providing a robust mechanism for undo and redo functionality.

### Storing State for Undo Operations

To enable undo operations, it's essential to store the state of the system before a command is executed. This can be achieved by extending the command interface to include an `undo` method. Optionally, a `redo` method can be implemented to reapply the command.

### Extending the Command Interface

Here is how you might extend a basic command interface to support undo and redo operations:

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
    // Optional redo method
    void redo();
}
```

### Implementing Undoable Commands

Let's consider a simple example of a text editor where we can add and remove text. We'll implement commands for adding and removing text, along with their undo operations.

```java
public class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();

    public void addText(String newText) {
        text.append(newText);
    }

    public void removeText(int length) {
        text.delete(text.length() - length, text.length());
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text.toString();
    }
}

public class AddTextCommand implements Command {
    private TextEditor editor;
    private String textToAdd;

    public AddTextCommand(TextEditor editor, String textToAdd) {
        this.editor = editor;
        this.textToAdd = textToAdd;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        editor.addText(textToAdd);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        editor.removeText(textToAdd.length());
    }

    @Override
    public void redo() {
        execute();
    }
}
```

### Using Command Stacks for History

To track executed commands, we can use a stack or a history list. This allows us to easily manage the sequence of commands and perform undo or redo operations.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class CommandManager {
    private Stack<Command> commandHistory = new Stack<>();
    private Stack<Command> redoStack = new Stack<>();

    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        commandHistory.push(command);
        redoStack.clear(); // Clear redo stack on new command
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!commandHistory.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = commandHistory.pop();
            command.undo();
            redoStack.push(command);
        }
    }

    public void redo() {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = redoStack.pop();
            command.redo();
            commandHistory.push(command);
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling Complex State Changes

For complex state changes, ensure consistency during undo operations by carefully managing state snapshots. This might involve using the Memento pattern to capture and restore object states.

### Best Practices for Resource Management

When storing command history, consider memory usage. Limit the size of the command history stack or implement a mechanism to discard old commands if necessary. This prevents excessive memory consumption.

### Challenges with Non-Undoable Commands

Some commands, such as sending an email or irreversible database operations, cannot be easily undone. In such cases, consider alternative strategies, such as confirming actions with the user or using transactions that can be rolled back.

### Grouping Commands into Transactions

Commands can be grouped into composite commands or transactions to ensure atomicity. This is useful when multiple commands need to be undone or redone as a single unit.

```java
public class CompositeCommand implements Command {
    private List<Command> commands = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addCommand(Command command) {
        commands.add(command);
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        for (Command command : commands) {
            command.execute();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        for (int i = commands.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            commands.get(i).undo();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void redo() {
        execute();
    }
}
```

### Handling Multiple Undos and Redos

To handle multiple undos or redos in sequence, maintain a clear separation between the command history and the redo stack. This ensures that the system can correctly track and manage the sequence of commands.

### Real-World Examples

- **Text Editors**: Implementing undo/redo for text changes.
- **Graphics Software**: Reverting drawing actions or filters.
- **Transactional Systems**: Rolling back transactions in case of errors.

### Impact on User Experience

Responsive undo and redo operations enhance user experience by providing users with confidence in their actions. Ensure that these operations are fast and intuitive.

### Testing Undo and Redo Functionalities

Thorough testing is crucial to prevent data corruption. Test various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure that undo and redo functionalities work correctly.

### Complementing with the Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern can complement the Command pattern by capturing and restoring the state of an object. This is particularly useful for complex state changes.

### Thread Safety Considerations

When commands are executed concurrently, ensure thread safety by using appropriate synchronization mechanisms. This prevents race conditions and ensures consistent state management.
