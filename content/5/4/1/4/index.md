## 4.1.4 Example: Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are a fundamental part of computer science and software development. They are used to arrange data in a particular order, which is a common requirement in many applications. In this section, we will explore how the Strategy pattern can be applied to sorting algorithms in Java, allowing us to switch between different sorting strategies at runtime without altering the client code. This approach promotes flexibility, maintainability, and code reuse.

### Understanding the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The Strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

### Defining the `SortStrategy` Interface

To apply the Strategy pattern to sorting algorithms, we start by defining a `SortStrategy` interface. This interface will declare a method for sorting a list of elements.

```java
import java.util.List;

public interface SortStrategy<T extends Comparable<T>> {
    void sort(List<T> data);
}
```

The `SortStrategy` interface defines a generic `sort` method that takes a list of elements to be sorted. By using generics, we ensure type safety and flexibility, allowing the sorting strategies to work with any comparable type.

### Implementing Concrete Sorting Strategies

Let's implement three different sorting strategies: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. Each strategy will implement the `SortStrategy` interface.

#### BubbleSortStrategy

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

```java
import java.util.List;

public class BubbleSortStrategy<T extends Comparable<T>> implements SortStrategy<T> {
    @Override
    public void sort(List<T> data) {
        int n = data.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (data.get(j).compareTo(data.get(j + 1)) > 0) {
                    // Swap data[j] and data[j+1]
                    T temp = data.get(j);
                    data.set(j, data.get(j + 1));
                    data.set(j + 1, temp);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### QuickSortStrategy

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, which are then sorted recursively.

```java
import java.util.List;

public class QuickSortStrategy<T extends Comparable<T>> implements SortStrategy<T> {
    @Override
    public void sort(List<T> data) {
        quickSort(data, 0, data.size() - 1);
    }

    private void quickSort(List<T> data, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(data, low, high);
            quickSort(data, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(data, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(List<T> data, int low, int high) {
        T pivot = data.get(high);
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (data.get(j).compareTo(pivot) <= 0) {
                i++;
                // Swap data[i] and data[j]
                T temp = data.get(i);
                data.set(i, data.get(j));
                data.set(j, temp);
            }
        }
        // Swap data[i+1] and data[high] (or pivot)
        T temp = data.get(i + 1);
        data.set(i + 1, data.get(high));
        data.set(high, temp);
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```

#### MergeSortStrategy

Merge Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

```java
import java.util.List;

public class MergeSortStrategy<T extends Comparable<T>> implements SortStrategy<T> {
    @Override
    public void sort(List<T> data) {
        if (data.size() > 1) {
            int mid = data.size() / 2;
            List<T> left = data.subList(0, mid);
            List<T> right = data.subList(mid, data.size());

            sort(left);
            sort(right);

            merge(data, left, right);
        }
    }

    private void merge(List<T> data, List<T> left, List<T> right) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
        while (i < left.size() && j < right.size()) {
            if (left.get(i).compareTo(right.get(j)) <= 0) {
                data.set(k++, left.get(i++));
            } else {
                data.set(k++, right.get(j++));
            }
        }
        while (i < left.size()) {
            data.set(k++, left.get(i++));
        }
        while (j < right.size()) {
            data.set(k++, right.get(j++));
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating the `Sorter` Context Class

The `Sorter` class acts as a context that uses the `SortStrategy` interface to perform sorting. It can accept different sorting strategies and apply them to the data.

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Sorter<T extends Comparable<T>> {
    private SortStrategy<T> strategy;

    public Sorter(SortStrategy<T> strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(SortStrategy<T> strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void sort(List<T> data) {
        strategy.sort(data);
    }
}
```

### Using the `Sorter` Class with Different Strategies

The `Sorter` class allows us to switch sorting strategies at runtime. Here's how we can use it:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StrategyPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90);

        Sorter<Integer> sorter = new Sorter<>(new BubbleSortStrategy<>());
        System.out.println("Using Bubble Sort:");
        sorter.sort(numbers);
        System.out.println(numbers);

        sorter.setStrategy(new QuickSortStrategy<>());
        System.out.println("Using Quick Sort:");
        sorter.sort(numbers);
        System.out.println(numbers);

        sorter.setStrategy(new MergeSortStrategy<>());
        System.out.println("Using Merge Sort:");
        sorter.sort(numbers);
        System.out.println(numbers);
    }
}
```

### Criteria for Selecting a Sorting Strategy

Choosing the right sorting strategy depends on several factors:

- **Data Size:** Quick Sort is generally faster for large datasets, while Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets.
- **Orderliness:** If the data is nearly sorted, Bubble Sort might perform adequately due to its simplicity.
- **Memory Constraints:** Merge Sort requires additional memory for merging, which might be a concern in memory-constrained environments.

### Testing and Performance Considerations

Each sorting strategy should be tested independently for correctness and performance. Consider using Java's `JUnit` framework for unit testing. Measure performance using `System.nanoTime()` to compare execution times for different strategies.

### Benefits of Switching Algorithms at Runtime

The ability to switch sorting algorithms at runtime offers several benefits:

- **Flexibility:** Easily adapt to changing requirements or data characteristics.
- **Maintainability:** Add new sorting strategies without altering existing code.
- **Reusability:** Reuse the `Sorter` class with any sorting strategy.

### Potential Extensions

Consider extending the sorting strategies to include parallel sorting algorithms or external sorting for large datasets. Java's `ForkJoinPool` can be used for parallel sorting.

### Handling Exceptions and Edge Cases

Ensure that sorting strategies handle edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with null elements. Consider using Java's `Optional` class to handle null values gracefully.

### Promoting Code Reuse and Separation of Concerns

By encapsulating sorting algorithms within separate strategy classes, we achieve a clean separation of concerns. The `Sorter` class is decoupled from specific sorting implementations, promoting code reuse and flexibility.

### Logging and Monitoring Sorting Performance

Implement logging within sorting strategies to monitor performance and identify bottlenecks. Use Java's `Logger` class to log execution times and other relevant metrics.

### Exploring Other Algorithm Families

The Strategy pattern is not limited to sorting algorithms. It can be applied to other algorithm families, such as searching or pathfinding algorithms, where different strategies can be selected based on specific criteria.

### Conclusion

The Strategy pattern provides a powerful mechanism for implementing interchangeable sorting algorithms in Java. By encapsulating sorting logic within strategy classes, we achieve flexibility, maintainability, and reusability. This approach allows us to adapt to changing requirements and optimize performance based on specific data characteristics.
