## 4.7.3 Example: Logging with Multiple Levels

In modern software development, logging plays a crucial role in monitoring and debugging applications. A well-structured logging system allows developers to capture important events and diagnose issues efficiently. In this section, we explore how to implement a flexible logging system using the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in Java. This pattern enables us to process requests through a chain of handlers, allowing for dynamic addition and removal of logging capabilities without altering client code.

### Understanding the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one handles the request. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, promoting flexibility and reusability.

### Designing the Logging System

Our logging system will consist of a `Logger` abstract class that defines different logging levels, such as INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR. Concrete logger classes, like `ConsoleLogger`, `FileLogger`, and `ErrorLogger`, will extend this abstract class to handle specific logging tasks.

#### Defining the `Logger` Abstract Class

The `Logger` class will serve as the base class for all loggers. It will define the structure for handling log messages based on their levels.

```java
abstract class Logger {
    public static int INFO = 1;
    public static int DEBUG = 2;
    public static int ERROR = 3;

    protected int level;
    protected Logger nextLogger;

    public void setNextLogger(Logger nextLogger) {
        this.nextLogger = nextLogger;
    }

    public void logMessage(int level, String message) {
        if (this.level <= level) {
            write(message);
        }
        if (nextLogger != null) {
            nextLogger.logMessage(level, message);
        }
    }

    protected abstract void write(String message);
}
```

### Implementing Concrete Logger Classes

Each concrete logger will handle messages at its specified level and pass unhandled messages to the next logger in the chain.

#### ConsoleLogger

The `ConsoleLogger` writes log messages to the console.

```java
class ConsoleLogger extends Logger {

    public ConsoleLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("Console::Logger: " + message);
    }
}
```

#### FileLogger

The `FileLogger` writes log messages to a file.

```java
class FileLogger extends Logger {

    public FileLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        // Simulate writing to a file
        System.out.println("File::Logger: " + message);
    }
}
```

#### ErrorLogger

The `ErrorLogger` handles error-level messages.

```java
class ErrorLogger extends Logger {

    public ErrorLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.err.println("Error::Logger: " + message);
    }
}
```

### Setting Up the Logger Chain

To configure the chain, we instantiate each logger and set their order using the `setNextLogger` method.

```java
public class ChainPatternDemo {

    private static Logger getChainOfLoggers() {

        Logger errorLogger = new ErrorLogger(Logger.ERROR);
        Logger fileLogger = new FileLogger(Logger.DEBUG);
        Logger consoleLogger = new ConsoleLogger(Logger.INFO);

        errorLogger.setNextLogger(fileLogger);
        fileLogger.setNextLogger(consoleLogger);

        return errorLogger;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger loggerChain = getChainOfLoggers();

        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.INFO, "This is an information.");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.DEBUG, "This is a debug level information.");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.ERROR, "This is an error information.");
    }
}
```

### How the Chain Processes Messages

In this setup, a message is passed through the chain starting from the `ErrorLogger`. Each logger checks if it can handle the message based on its level. If it can, it processes the message; otherwise, it forwards the message to the next logger in the chain.

### Benefits of the Chain of Responsibility

- **Extensibility**: New loggers can be added or removed without modifying existing code.
- **Flexibility**: Loggers can be reconfigured dynamically, allowing for different logging strategies.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each logger handles specific tasks, promoting clean and maintainable code.

### Configuring the Logger Chain

While the above example hardcodes the chain configuration, in real-world applications, you might use configuration files or dependency injection frameworks like Spring to manage logger configurations. This approach enhances flexibility and allows for runtime adjustments.

### Handling Log Message Formatting

To include formatting, timestamps, or metadata, modify the `write` method in each logger. For example, you might prepend a timestamp to each message:

```java
@Override
protected void write(String message) {
    System.out.println("[" + LocalDateTime.now() + "] Console::Logger: " + message);
}
```

### Testing the Logging System

To ensure correct logging behavior, write unit tests for each logger. Mocking frameworks like Mockito can simulate different logging scenarios, verifying that messages are logged at the correct levels.

### Extending the Logging System

Consider extending the system with new loggers, such as `DatabaseLogger` or `NetworkLogger`. This can be done seamlessly by creating new classes that extend the `Logger` abstract class and adding them to the chain.

### Performance Optimization

For high-performance applications, consider asynchronous logging to prevent blocking operations. Java's `ExecutorService` can be used to handle logging tasks in separate threads, improving responsiveness.

### Managing Log Levels and Resources

Log levels significantly impact performance. Ensure that only necessary messages are logged, especially in production environments. Also, manage resources like file handles carefully, ensuring they are closed properly to prevent resource leaks.

### Demonstrating the Chain of Responsibility Pattern

This logging system exemplifies the Chain of Responsibility pattern by allowing requests (log messages) to pass through a chain of handlers (loggers), each capable of processing or forwarding the request. This decouples the sender from the receivers, promoting a clean and flexible architecture.

### Conclusion

Implementing a logging system using the Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a robust and flexible solution for managing log messages across different levels and destinations. By following best practices and considering performance implications, developers can create efficient logging systems that enhance application maintainability and debugging capabilities.
