## 4.2.2 Implementing the Strategy Pattern in JavaScript

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful behavioral design pattern that enables a class's behavior or its algorithm to be changed at runtime. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to select an algorithm's behavior dynamically based on user input, configuration, or other runtime conditions. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Strategy Pattern in JavaScript, leveraging both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

### Understanding the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. The key components of the Strategy Pattern are:

- **Strategy Interface**: Defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.
- **Concrete Strategies**: Implement the Strategy interface with specific algorithms.
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the execution to the currently set strategy.

### Defining a Strategy Interface in JavaScript

In JavaScript, interfaces are not explicitly defined as in strongly typed languages like TypeScript or Java. However, we can simulate interfaces using classes or functions. Let's start by defining a Strategy interface using JavaScript functions.

#### Using Functions

```javascript
// Define a Strategy interface using a function
function Strategy() {
  this.execute = function() {
    throw new Error("Strategy#execute needs to be overridden");
  };
}
```

#### Using Classes

In modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond), we can use classes to define a Strategy interface:

```javascript
// Define a Strategy interface using a class
class Strategy {
  execute() {
    throw new Error("Strategy#execute needs to be overridden");
  }
}
```

### Implementing Concrete Strategies

Concrete strategies implement the Strategy interface. Each concrete strategy encapsulates a specific algorithm.

#### Example: Sorting Algorithms

Let's implement two concrete strategies for sorting: BubbleSort and QuickSort.

```javascript
// Concrete strategy for Bubble Sort
class BubbleSort extends Strategy {
  execute(data) {
    console.log("Sorting using Bubble Sort");
    // Implement Bubble Sort algorithm
    // ...
    return data;
  }
}

// Concrete strategy for Quick Sort
class QuickSort extends Strategy {
  execute(data) {
    console.log("Sorting using Quick Sort");
    // Implement Quick Sort algorithm
    // ...
    return data;
  }
}
```

### Creating a Context Class

The Context class holds a reference to a Strategy object and delegates the execution to the strategy.

```javascript
// Context class
class SortContext {
  constructor(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  setStrategy(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  executeStrategy(data) {
    return this.strategy.execute(data);
  }
}
```

### Switching Strategies at Runtime

One of the significant advantages of the Strategy Pattern is the ability to switch strategies at runtime. This can be achieved by setting a new strategy in the Context class.

```javascript
// Example usage
const data = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2];
const bubbleSort = new BubbleSort();
const quickSort = new QuickSort();

const context = new SortContext(bubbleSort);
context.executeStrategy(data); // Output: Sorting using Bubble Sort

context.setStrategy(quickSort);
context.executeStrategy(data); // Output: Sorting using Quick Sort
```

### Handling Additional Parameters

Strategies often require additional parameters to function correctly. These can be passed directly to the strategy's execute method.

```javascript
class CustomSort extends Strategy {
  execute(data, order = 'asc') {
    console.log(`Sorting in ${order} order`);
    // Implement custom sorting logic
    // ...
    return data;
  }
}

// Using CustomSort strategy
const customSort = new CustomSort();
context.setStrategy(customSort);
context.executeStrategy(data, 'desc'); // Output: Sorting in desc order
```

### Avoiding Tight Coupling

To avoid tight coupling between the Context and Concrete Strategies, ensure that the Context only interacts with the Strategy interface. This promotes flexibility and scalability.

### Composition Over Inheritance

In JavaScript, prefer composition over inheritance when implementing strategies. This approach provides greater flexibility and reusability.

### Using Higher-Order Functions as Strategies

In functional programming, higher-order functions can serve as strategies. A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

```javascript
// Higher-order function as a strategy
function bubbleSortStrategy(data) {
  console.log("Sorting using Bubble Sort (Functional)");
  // Implement Bubble Sort algorithm
  // ...
  return data;
}

function quickSortStrategy(data) {
  console.log("Sorting using Quick Sort (Functional)");
  // Implement Quick Sort algorithm
  // ...
  return data;
}

// Context using higher-order functions
class FunctionalSortContext {
  constructor(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  setStrategy(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  executeStrategy(data) {
    return this.strategy(data);
  }
}

// Example usage
const functionalContext = new FunctionalSortContext(bubbleSortStrategy);
functionalContext.executeStrategy(data); // Output: Sorting using Bubble Sort (Functional)

functionalContext.setStrategy(quickSortStrategy);
functionalContext.executeStrategy(data); // Output: Sorting using Quick Sort (Functional)
```

### Organizing Strategy Code for Scalability

Organize strategy code into separate modules or files for better scalability and maintainability. This approach aligns with the single responsibility principle, making it easier to manage and extend the codebase.

### Selecting Strategies Dynamically

Strategies can be selected dynamically based on configuration or user input. This can be achieved by mapping strategy names to their corresponding implementations.

```javascript
const strategies = {
  bubble: bubbleSortStrategy,
  quick: quickSortStrategy,
  custom: customSortStrategy
};

function selectStrategy(strategyName) {
  return strategies[strategyName] || bubbleSortStrategy;
}

// Example usage
const userSelectedStrategy = 'quick';
functionalContext.setStrategy(selectStrategy(userSelectedStrategy));
functionalContext.executeStrategy(data); // Output: Sorting using Quick Sort (Functional)
```

### Performance Considerations

Frequent switching of strategies can have performance implications, especially if the strategies involve complex computations. Optimize strategy selection and execution to minimize overhead.

### Error Handling in Strategies

Implement robust error handling within strategies to ensure that errors do not propagate to the Context or client code. Use try-catch blocks and handle specific errors gracefully.

```javascript
class SafeSort extends Strategy {
  execute(data) {
    try {
      console.log("Executing safe sort");
      // Implement sorting logic with error handling
      // ...
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error during sorting:", error);
      return data;
    }
  }
}
```

### Writing Unit Tests for Strategies

Unit tests are crucial for verifying the correctness of each strategy. Test each strategy in isolation to ensure it behaves as expected.

```javascript
// Example unit test for BubbleSort strategy
describe('BubbleSort Strategy', () => {
  it('should sort the array in ascending order', () => {
    const bubbleSort = new BubbleSort();
    const data = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2];
    const sortedData = bubbleSort.execute(data);
    expect(sortedData).toEqual([1, 2, 3, 5, 8]);
  });
});
```

### Conclusion

The Strategy Pattern is a versatile and powerful tool in a developer's toolkit, offering flexibility and scalability in designing algorithms that can change dynamically at runtime. By understanding and implementing the Strategy Pattern in JavaScript, developers can create robust and maintainable codebases that adapt to changing requirements and conditions.
