## 2.2.2 Implementing Factory Methods in Java

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to instantiate objects directly, thus adhering to the principle of programming to an interface rather than an implementation.

### Understanding the Factory Method Pattern

Before diving into the implementation, let's break down the key components of the Factory Method pattern:

1. **Product Interface/Abstract Class**: Defines the interface or abstract class that all concrete products will implement.
2. **Concrete Products**: These are the classes that implement the Product interface.
3. **Creator Class**: Contains the factory method that returns a Product object. This method is usually abstract.
4. **Concrete Creators**: Subclasses of the Creator class that implement the factory method to produce specific products.

### Implementing the Factory Method Pattern in Java

Let's explore a step-by-step implementation of the Factory Method pattern in Java through a practical example. We'll create a simple application that simulates a document editor supporting different document types (e.g., Word, PDF).

#### Step 1: Define the Product Interface

First, we define the `Document` interface that all document types will implement.

```java
// Product Interface
public interface Document {
    void open();
    void save();
    void close();
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Products

Next, we implement concrete classes for each document type, such as `WordDocument` and `PDFDocument`.

```java
// Concrete Product: WordDocument
public class WordDocument implements Document {
    @Override
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening Word document...");
    }

    @Override
    public void save() {
        System.out.println("Saving Word document...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Closing Word document...");
    }
}

// Concrete Product: PDFDocument
public class PDFDocument implements Document {
    @Override
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening PDF document...");
    }

    @Override
    public void save() {
        System.out.println("Saving PDF document...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Closing PDF document...");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Creator Class

The `Application` class acts as the creator, declaring the factory method `createDocument()`.

```java
// Creator Class
public abstract class Application {
    // Factory Method
    protected abstract Document createDocument();

    // Other methods that use the factory method
    public void newDocument() {
        Document doc = createDocument();
        doc.open();
        doc.save();
        doc.close();
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Implement Concrete Creators

Concrete creator classes override the factory method to produce specific products.

```java
// Concrete Creator: WordApplication
public class WordApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    protected Document createDocument() {
        return new WordDocument();
    }
}

// Concrete Creator: PDFApplication
public class PDFApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    protected Document createDocument() {
        return new PDFDocument();
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Client Interaction

The client interacts with the creator class, using the factory method to create and manipulate products.

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application wordApp = new WordApplication();
        wordApp.newDocument();

        Application pdfApp = new PDFApplication();
        pdfApp.newDocument();
    }
}
```

### How the Factory Method Pattern Promotes Flexibility

The Factory Method pattern enhances flexibility in object creation by allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This approach follows the Open/Closed Principle, enabling the system to be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Inheritance and Polymorphism

The pattern leverages inheritance to provide a default implementation of the factory method in the creator class. Polymorphism is used to allow concrete creators to override this method, providing specific implementations for creating products.

#### Handling Parameters in Factory Methods

If the factory method requires parameters to determine the type of product to create, you can pass these parameters to the method. This approach allows for more dynamic product creation.

```java
// Example of a parameterized factory method
public abstract class ParameterizedApplication {
    protected abstract Document createDocument(String type);

    public void newDocument(String type) {
        Document doc = createDocument(type);
        doc.open();
        doc.save();
        doc.close();
    }
}
```

### Examples in Java's Standard Libraries

The Factory Method pattern is prevalent in Java's standard libraries. For instance, the `java.util.Calendar` class uses a factory method to create calendar instances.

```java
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
```

### Impact on Maintainability and Extensibility

By decoupling the instantiation process from the client, the Factory Method pattern improves maintainability and extensibility. New product types can be added with minimal changes to existing code, as only new concrete product and creator classes need to be introduced.

### Encouraging Experimentation

To fully grasp the Factory Method pattern, experiment with different implementations. Try creating additional document types or modifying the factory method to accept parameters. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding and reveal the pattern's versatility.

### Conclusion

The Factory Method pattern is a powerful tool in the Java developer's toolkit, promoting flexibility and maintainability in object-oriented design. By understanding and implementing this pattern, you can create robust applications that are easy to extend and maintain.
