## 2.4.5 Example: Building a House Object

The Builder pattern is a powerful creational design pattern that provides a flexible solution to constructing complex objects. In this section, we'll explore how to implement a `House` class using the Builder pattern in Java. This approach will help manage the complexity of object creation, especially when dealing with objects that have numerous optional attributes.

### Defining the House Class

Let's start by defining the `House` class. A house can have several attributes such as the number of rooms, windows, doors, and whether it includes a garage, swimming pool, or garden. Here's a basic structure for our `House` class:

```java
public class House {
    private final int rooms;
    private final int windows;
    private final int doors;
    private final boolean hasGarage;
    private final boolean hasSwimmingPool;
    private final boolean hasGarden;

    private House(HouseBuilder builder) {
        this.rooms = builder.rooms;
        this.windows = builder.windows;
        this.doors = builder.doors;
        this.hasGarage = builder.hasGarage;
        this.hasSwimmingPool = builder.hasSwimmingPool;
        this.hasGarden = builder.hasGarden;
    }

    // Getters for the attributes
    public int getRooms() { return rooms; }
    public int getWindows() { return windows; }
    public int getDoors() { return doors; }
    public boolean hasGarage() { return hasGarage; }
    public boolean hasSwimmingPool() { return hasSwimmingPool; }
    public boolean hasGarden() { return hasGarden; }
}
```

### Implementing the HouseBuilder Class

The `HouseBuilder` class is a static nested class within `House`. It provides methods to set the attributes of `House` and a `build()` method to create the `House` object.

```java
public static class HouseBuilder {
    private int rooms;
    private int windows;
    private int doors;
    private boolean hasGarage;
    private boolean hasSwimmingPool;
    private boolean hasGarden;

    public HouseBuilder setRooms(int rooms) {
        if (rooms < 1) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("A house must have at least one room.");
        }
        this.rooms = rooms;
        return this;
    }

    public HouseBuilder setWindows(int windows) {
        this.windows = windows;
        return this;
    }

    public HouseBuilder setDoors(int doors) {
        this.doors = doors;
        return this;
    }

    public HouseBuilder setGarage(boolean hasGarage) {
        this.hasGarage = hasGarage;
        return this;
    }

    public HouseBuilder setSwimmingPool(boolean hasSwimmingPool) {
        this.hasSwimmingPool = hasSwimmingPool;
        return this;
    }

    public HouseBuilder setGarden(boolean hasGarden) {
        this.hasGarden = hasGarden;
        return this;
    }

    public House build() {
        return new House(this);
    }
}
```

### Creating Different Types of Houses

Using the `HouseBuilder`, we can easily create different types of houses by selectively setting attributes. Here's how we can create a simple house and a luxurious villa:

```java
public class HouseBuilderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Building a simple house
        House simpleHouse = new House.HouseBuilder()
            .setRooms(3)
            .setWindows(5)
            .setDoors(2)
            .build();

        // Building a luxurious villa
        House luxuryVilla = new House.HouseBuilder()
            .setRooms(10)
            .setWindows(20)
            .setDoors(5)
            .setGarage(true)
            .setSwimmingPool(true)
            .setGarden(true)
            .build();

        System.out.println("Simple House: " + simpleHouse.getRooms() + " rooms, " + (simpleHouse.hasGarage() ? "with" : "without") + " garage.");
        System.out.println("Luxury Villa: " + luxuryVilla.getRooms() + " rooms, " + (luxuryVilla.hasSwimmingPool() ? "with" : "without") + " swimming pool.");
    }
}
```

### Advantages of Using the Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern offers several advantages:

- **Clarity and Flexibility**: It provides a clear and flexible way to construct objects, especially when dealing with numerous optional parameters.
- **Avoids Constructor Overloading**: Instead of creating multiple constructors for different combinations of parameters, the Builder pattern uses method chaining to set parameters.
- **Improves Maintainability**: Changes to the object construction process are localized within the builder, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

### Handling Optional Features

The Builder pattern handles optional features gracefully. For instance, attributes like `hasGarage`, `hasSwimmingPool`, and `hasGarden` are optional and can be set based on the requirements. This flexibility allows us to create a wide variety of house configurations without cluttering the code with numerous constructors.

### Implementing Validation Logic

Validation logic can be incorporated into the builder methods to ensure that the constructed object is always in a valid state. For example, the `setRooms()` method checks that the number of rooms is at least one, throwing an exception if this condition is not met.

### Testing Strategies

Testing the `House` and `HouseBuilder` classes involves verifying that the builder correctly constructs `House` objects with the desired attributes. Unit tests can be written to ensure that each builder method sets the correct attribute and that the `build()` method creates a `House` object with the expected state.

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class HouseBuilderTest {

    @Test
    public void testHouseBuilder() {
        House house = new House.HouseBuilder()
            .setRooms(4)
            .setWindows(8)
            .setDoors(3)
            .setGarage(true)
            .build();

        assertEquals(4, house.getRooms());
        assertEquals(8, house.getWindows());
        assertEquals(3, house.getDoors());
        assertTrue(house.hasGarage());
        assertFalse(house.hasSwimmingPool());
    }

    @Test
    public void testInvalidHouse() {
        Exception exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            new House.HouseBuilder().setRooms(0).build();
        });

        assertEquals("A house must have at least one room.", exception.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### Extending the Model

As more features are added to the `House` class, the Builder pattern makes it easy to extend the model. New attributes can be added to the `House` and `HouseBuilder` classes without affecting existing code, ensuring backward compatibility.

### Applying the Builder Pattern in Real-World Scenarios

The Builder pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where objects have numerous optional attributes or require complex construction logic. It's commonly used in UI frameworks, configuration objects, and data transfer objects (DTOs) where flexibility and clarity are paramount.

### Conclusion

The Builder pattern is a valuable tool in the Java developer's toolkit, providing a robust solution for constructing complex objects. By implementing the `House` class with a nested `HouseBuilder`, we achieve clarity, flexibility, and maintainability in our code. This pattern is applicable in many real-world scenarios, making it an essential concept to master for building robust applications.
