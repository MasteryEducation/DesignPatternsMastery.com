## 2.1.3.1 Synchronized Methods

In the realm of Java design patterns, the Singleton pattern is a widely used creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. However, when it comes to multi-threaded environments, the classic Singleton implementation can fall short, leading to potential issues with thread safety. This section delves into the use of synchronized methods as a solution to these issues, exploring their implementation, performance implications, and alternative strategies.

### Why the Classic Singleton Implementation is Not Thread-Safe

The classic Singleton pattern is typically implemented with a static method that checks if an instance of the class already exists. If not, it creates one. However, this approach is not thread-safe because multiple threads could simultaneously enter the `getInstance()` method and create multiple instances of the Singleton class.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

In the above implementation, if two threads access `getInstance()` at the same time, they might both see `instance` as `null` and create separate instances, violating the Singleton principle.

### Using Synchronization for Thread Safety

To make the `getInstance()` method thread-safe, Java provides the `synchronized` keyword, which can be used to ensure that only one thread can execute a method at a time. By synchronizing the `getInstance()` method, we can prevent multiple threads from creating multiple instances of the Singleton class.

#### Implementing Synchronized `getInstance()`

Here's how you can declare the `getInstance()` method with the `synchronized` keyword:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Performance Implications of Synchronizing the Entire Method

While synchronizing the `getInstance()` method solves the thread safety issue, it introduces a performance bottleneck. Synchronizing a method means that every call to `getInstance()` must acquire a lock, even if the Singleton instance has already been created. This can significantly degrade performance, especially in applications with high concurrency.

#### Bottlenecks in Highly Concurrent Applications

In highly concurrent applications, synchronized methods can lead to contention, where threads are forced to wait for the lock, reducing throughput and increasing response time. This is particularly problematic in scenarios where `getInstance()` is called frequently.

### Scenarios Where Method-Level Synchronization May Be Acceptable

Method-level synchronization might be acceptable in applications where:

- The Singleton instance is accessed infrequently.
- The overhead of synchronization is negligible compared to other operations.
- Simplicity and ease of understanding are prioritized over performance.

### Alternative Synchronization Strategies

To improve performance while maintaining thread safety, consider these alternative strategies:

#### Double-Checked Locking

Double-checked locking reduces the overhead of acquiring a lock by first checking if the instance is already created without synchronization. Only if the instance is `null`, the method synchronizes and creates the instance.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation

The Bill Pugh Singleton pattern uses a static inner helper class to hold the Singleton instance. This approach leverages the Java class loading mechanism to ensure thread safety without synchronization.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    private static class SingletonHelper {
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

### Testing Thread-Safe Singleton in Multi-Threaded Environments

Testing is crucial to ensure that your Singleton implementation is truly thread-safe. Use multi-threaded test cases to simulate concurrent access and verify that only one instance is created.

### Avoiding Deadlocks

Deadlocks can occur if synchronized methods are used improperly, especially when multiple locks are involved. To avoid deadlocks:

- Minimize the scope of synchronized code.
- Avoid nested synchronized blocks.
- Use lock ordering to prevent circular wait conditions.

### Impact on Scalability

Synchronized methods can impact the scalability of your application by limiting the number of threads that can execute concurrently. Profiling your application can help assess the synchronization overhead and guide optimization efforts.

### Conclusion

Synchronized methods provide a straightforward way to ensure thread safety in Singleton patterns, but they come with performance trade-offs. By understanding these implications and exploring alternative strategies like double-checked locking and the Bill Pugh Singleton, you can make informed decisions to balance thread safety and performance in your Java applications.
