## 7.2.3 Combining Async/Await with Other Async Patterns

Asynchronous programming in JavaScript has evolved significantly, offering developers a variety of patterns to handle concurrent operations. Among these, `async/await` stands out for its simplicity and readability. However, real-world applications often require integrating `async/await` with other asynchronous patterns such as callbacks, Promises, event emitters, streams, and Observables. This section explores how to effectively combine `async/await` with these patterns, providing practical examples and best practices to enhance your JavaScript and TypeScript development.

### Integrating Async/Await with Callback-Based Functions

#### Understanding Callbacks

Callbacks are one of the oldest asynchronous patterns in JavaScript. A callback function is passed as an argument to another function and is executed once a certain task is completed. While effective, callbacks can lead to deeply nested code, commonly known as "callback hell."

#### Promisifying Callbacks

To integrate `async/await` with callback-based functions, we often need to convert these functions into Promises, a process known as promisification. Node.js provides a built-in utility, `util.promisify`, to facilitate this conversion.

**Example: Promisifying a Callback Function Using `util.promisify`**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const util = require('util');

// Original callback-based function
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Promisified version
const readFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.readFile);

(async () => {
  try {
    const data = await readFileAsync('example.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

**Custom Promisification**

For environments where `util.promisify` is unavailable, or for custom callback functions, you can manually create a Promise wrapper.

```javascript
function customPromisify(fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fn(...args, (err, result) => {
        if (err) return reject(err);
        resolve(result);
      });
    });
  };
}

// Example usage
const readFileAsyncCustom = customPromisify(fs.readFile);

(async () => {
  try {
    const data = await readFileAsyncCustom('example.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

### Using Async/Await with Event Emitters and Streams

#### Event Emitters

Node.js's `EventEmitter` is a powerful pattern for handling asynchronous events. However, integrating it with `async/await` requires some creativity, as event emitters do not natively support Promises.

**Example: Wrapping Event Emitters with Promises**

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');

function waitForEvent(emitter, event) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    emitter.once(event, resolve);
  });
}

const emitter = new EventEmitter();

(async () => {
  setTimeout(() => emitter.emit('data', 'Hello, World!'), 1000);
  const data = await waitForEvent(emitter, 'data');
  console.log(data); // Outputs: Hello, World!
})();
```

#### Streams

Streams in Node.js can be handled using `async/await` by converting them into async iterators.

**Example: Using Async Iterators with Streams**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

async function readStreamAsync(stream) {
  for await (const chunk of stream) {
    console.log(chunk.toString());
  }
}

const stream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });
readStreamAsync(stream);
```

### Async/Await with Asynchronous Iterators and Generators

Asynchronous iterators and generators allow you to iterate over data sources that return Promises. The `for await...of` loop is a powerful tool for consuming these iterators.

**Example: Using `for await...of` with Async Generators**

```javascript
async function* asyncGenerator() {
  yield new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('First'), 1000));
  yield new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('Second'), 1000));
  yield new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('Third'), 1000));
}

(async () => {
  for await (const value of asyncGenerator()) {
    console.log(value);
  }
})();
```

### Integrating Async/Await with Observables

Observables, particularly in libraries like RxJS, provide a robust pattern for handling streams of data. While `async/await` does not directly integrate with Observables, you can convert Observables to Promises to use them in async functions.

**Example: Converting an Observable to a Promise**

```javascript
const { from } = require('rxjs');
const { toPromise } = require('rxjs/operators');

const observable = from([1, 2, 3]);

async function processObservable() {
  const result = await observable.pipe(toPromise());
  console.log(result); // Outputs: 3
}

processObservable();
```

### Handling Cancellation and Timeouts

Cancellation and timeouts are crucial in managing long-running async operations. JavaScript's `AbortController` provides a way to signal cancellation.

**Example: Using `AbortController` for Cancellation**

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000); // Cancel after 5 seconds

(async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com', { signal });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Fetch aborted');
    } else {
      console.error(err);
    }
  }
})();
```

### Challenges and Best Practices

#### Mixing Async/Await with Promises and Callbacks

Combining different async paradigms can lead to complexity. It is essential to maintain readability and avoid deeply nested structures. Prefer `async/await` for new code, and refactor existing Promise chains where possible.

**Example: Refactoring Promise Chains**

```javascript
// Promise chain
function fetchData() {
  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
}

// Refactored with async/await
async function fetchDataAsync() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

#### Error Stacks and Debugging

Error handling in mixed environments can be challenging. Use tools and techniques such as source maps and logging to improve debugging.

#### Managing Context (`this`) in Async Functions

When using async functions as class methods, ensure the correct context is maintained. Use arrow functions or `bind` to preserve `this`.

**Example: Preserving Context in Class Methods**

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this.value = 42;
  }

  async method() {
    console.log(this.value);
  }
}

const instance = new MyClass();
instance.method(); // Correctly logs 42
```

### Resource Cleanup in Async Functions

Ensure proper cleanup of resources, such as closing database connections, in async functions. Use `finally` blocks for cleanup logic.

**Example: Resource Cleanup with `finally`**

```javascript
async function fetchDataAndCleanup() {
  let connection;
  try {
    connection = await db.connect();
    const data = await connection.query('SELECT * FROM table');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } finally {
    if (connection) {
      connection.close();
    }
  }
}
```

### Consistent Coding Standards

Adopt consistent coding standards and patterns when combining async paradigms. This consistency aids in code readability and maintainability.

### Future Language Features

Stay informed about future language features that may enhance asynchronous programming, such as improvements to async iterators and new concurrency primitives.

### Conclusion

Combining `async/await` with other asynchronous patterns can significantly enhance the flexibility and readability of your code. By understanding how to integrate these patterns effectively, you can build robust and maintainable applications. Remember to follow best practices, handle errors gracefully, and ensure proper resource management.
