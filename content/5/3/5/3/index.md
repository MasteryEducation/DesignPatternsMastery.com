## 3.5.3 Implementing Proxies in Java

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is particularly useful for adding functionality such as access control, logging, or lazy initialization without changing the original object's code. In this section, we'll delve into implementing proxies in Java, exploring both static and dynamic approaches.

### Understanding the Proxy Pattern

Before diving into implementation, let's briefly revisit the core idea of the Proxy Pattern. A proxy acts as an intermediary for a subject, providing controlled access to it. There are several types of proxies, including:

- **Virtual Proxy**: Delays the creation and initialization of an expensive object until it's needed.
- **Protection Proxy**: Controls access to the original object, often used for security purposes.
- **Remote Proxy**: Represents an object located in a different address space.
- **Smart Proxy**: Adds additional functionality, such as reference counting or logging.

### Defining the Subject's Contract

In Java, we typically use interfaces or abstract classes to define the contract for the subject. This ensures that both the real subject and the proxy adhere to the same interface, allowing them to be interchangeable.

```java
public interface Image {
    void display();
}
```

### Implementing a Static Proxy

A static proxy is a straightforward implementation where the proxy class explicitly implements the same interface as the real subject. Let's illustrate this with a simple example where a proxy adds logging functionality to an image display operation.

#### Real Subject

```java
public class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading " + filename);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying " + filename);
    }
}
```

#### Proxy Class

```java
public class ImageProxy implements Image {
    private RealImage realImage;
    private String filename;

    public ImageProxy(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        System.out.println("Logging: Displaying image");
        realImage.display();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ImageProxy` class controls access to the `RealImage` by adding logging functionality before delegating the call to the real subject.

### Dynamic Proxies in Java

Java provides a powerful mechanism for creating proxies at runtime using the `Proxy` class and `InvocationHandler` interface. This approach is particularly useful for implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging, transactions, or security.

#### Using Dynamic Proxies

Dynamic proxies are created using the `Proxy.newProxyInstance` method, which requires an `InvocationHandler` to define the behavior of method calls on the proxy instance.

#### `InvocationHandler` Interface

The `InvocationHandler` interface has a single method, `invoke`, which is called whenever a method is invoked on the proxy instance.

```java
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;

public class ImageInvocationHandler implements InvocationHandler {
    private final Image realImage;

    public ImageInvocationHandler(Image realImage) {
        this.realImage = realImage;
    }

    @Override
    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Logging: " + method.getName() + " method called");
        return method.invoke(realImage, args);
    }
}
```

#### Creating a Dynamic Proxy

```java
public class DynamicProxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RealImage realImage = new RealImage("photo.jpg");
        Image proxyInstance = (Image) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
                realImage.getClass().getClassLoader(),
                realImage.getClass().getInterfaces(),
                new ImageInvocationHandler(realImage)
        );

        proxyInstance.display();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ImageInvocationHandler` adds logging functionality to all method calls on the `RealImage` object. The dynamic proxy is created at runtime, demonstrating the flexibility of this approach.

### Advantages of Dynamic Proxies

Dynamic proxies offer several benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Easily implement cross-cutting concerns without modifying the original class.
- **Flexibility**: Apply the same proxy logic to multiple classes implementing the same interface.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Avoid writing separate proxy classes for each real subject.

### Considerations for Serialization and Cloning

When using proxies, especially dynamic ones, consider how they interact with serialization and cloning:

- **Serialization**: Ensure that both the proxy and the real subject are serializable if needed. Dynamic proxies may require custom serialization logic.
- **Cloning**: Proxies can complicate cloning operations. Consider implementing custom clone methods to handle proxy-specific state.

### Managing Lifecycle and Complexity

Managing the lifecycle of both proxy and real subject instances is crucial:

- **Initialization**: Ensure that the real subject is initialized only when necessary, especially in virtual proxies.
- **Resource Management**: Clean up resources held by proxies to avoid memory leaks.

While proxies add flexibility, they can also increase complexity. Consider the following best practices:

- **Code Clarity**: Keep proxy logic simple and focused on specific concerns.
- **Avoid Tight Coupling**: Use interfaces to decouple proxies from real subjects.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test proxy behavior to ensure it correctly delegates to the real subject.

### Leveraging Frameworks

Frameworks like Spring AOP leverage proxies to implement aspect-oriented programming (AOP), allowing developers to apply cross-cutting concerns declaratively. Exploring such frameworks can further enhance your understanding and application of proxies in Java.

### Conclusion

Implementing proxies in Java provides a powerful tool for controlling access to objects and adding functionality transparently. By understanding both static and dynamic approaches, you can choose the best method for your application's needs. Remember to consider lifecycle management, serialization, and complexity to maintain robust and maintainable code.
