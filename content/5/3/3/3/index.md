## 3.3.3 Facade Pattern in TypeScript

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. By encapsulating the complexities of the subsystem, the Facade Pattern makes it easier for clients to interact with the system without needing to understand its intricacies. In this section, we'll explore how to implement the Facade Pattern in TypeScript, leveraging its powerful features such as interfaces, strong typing, and access modifiers to create a robust and maintainable solution.

### Understanding the Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern is designed to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. This pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. It's particularly useful when dealing with complex systems that have multiple interdependent classes.

#### Key Components of the Facade Pattern

- **Facade**: The main component that provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem. It delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.
- **Subsystem Classes**: The classes that perform the actual work. They implement the subsystem's functionality and are often complex and interdependent.
- **Client**: The entity that interacts with the Facade rather than directly with the subsystem classes.

### Implementing the Facade Pattern in TypeScript

To implement the Facade Pattern in TypeScript, we'll start by defining the subsystem classes, then create a Facade class that provides a simplified interface to these classes.

#### Defining Subsystem Classes

Let's consider a simple example of a home theater system with various components like a DVD player, amplifier, and projector. Each component has its own set of operations.

```typescript
class DVDPlayer {
    play() {
        console.log("Playing DVD...");
    }

    stop() {
        console.log("Stopping DVD...");
    }
}

class Amplifier {
    on() {
        console.log("Amplifier is on.");
    }

    setVolume(volume: number) {
        console.log(`Setting volume to ${volume}.`);
    }
}

class Projector {
    turnOn() {
        console.log("Projector is on.");
    }

    setInput(input: string) {
        console.log(`Setting projector input to ${input}.`);
    }
}
```

#### Creating the Facade

Now, we'll create a `HomeTheaterFacade` class that provides a simple interface to control the entire home theater system. This class will use TypeScript's interfaces and access modifiers to define its contract with the client and control the visibility of subsystem methods.

```typescript
interface HomeTheaterFacade {
    watchMovie(): void;
    endMovie(): void;
}

class SimpleHomeTheaterFacade implements HomeTheaterFacade {
    private dvdPlayer: DVDPlayer;
    private amplifier: Amplifier;
    private projector: Projector;

    constructor(dvdPlayer: DVDPlayer, amplifier: Amplifier, projector: Projector) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        this.amplifier = amplifier;
        this.projector = projector;
    }

    public watchMovie(): void {
        this.projector.turnOn();
        this.projector.setInput("DVD");
        this.amplifier.on();
        this.amplifier.setVolume(5);
        this.dvdPlayer.play();
        console.log("Enjoy your movie!");
    }

    public endMovie(): void {
        this.dvdPlayer.stop();
        console.log("Shutting down the home theater...");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SimpleHomeTheaterFacade` class provides two simple methods, `watchMovie` and `endMovie`, which internally call multiple methods on the subsystem classes. The client can now control the entire home theater system with just these two methods, without needing to interact with the individual components directly.

### Leveraging TypeScript's Features

TypeScript's strong typing and interfaces play a crucial role in implementing the Facade Pattern effectively. Let's explore how these features enhance the implementation.

#### Using Interfaces for Strong Typing

By defining an interface for the Facade, we establish a clear contract between the Facade and its clients. This ensures that the Facade provides consistent functionality and helps prevent misuse.

#### Access Modifiers for Encapsulation

TypeScript's access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) allow us to control the visibility of the subsystem methods. In the `SimpleHomeTheaterFacade` class, the subsystem components are marked as `private`, ensuring that clients cannot access them directly.

#### Handling Asynchronous Operations

In real-world applications, subsystems often involve asynchronous operations. TypeScript's `async` and `await` keywords make it straightforward to handle asynchronous tasks within the Facade.

```typescript
class AsyncDVDPlayer {
    async play(): Promise<void> {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            console.log("Playing DVD...");
            setTimeout(() => resolve(), 1000);
        });
    }

    async stop(): Promise<void> {
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
            console.log("Stopping DVD...");
            setTimeout(() => resolve(), 500);
        });
    }
}

class AsyncHomeTheaterFacade implements HomeTheaterFacade {
    private dvdPlayer: AsyncDVDPlayer;
    private amplifier: Amplifier;
    private projector: Projector;

    constructor(dvdPlayer: AsyncDVDPlayer, amplifier: Amplifier, projector: Projector) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        this.amplifier = amplifier;
        this.projector = projector;
    }

    public async watchMovie(): Promise<void> {
        this.projector.turnOn();
        this.projector.setInput("DVD");
        this.amplifier.on();
        this.amplifier.setVolume(5);
        await this.dvdPlayer.play();
        console.log("Enjoy your movie!");
    }

    public async endMovie(): Promise<void> {
        await this.dvdPlayer.stop();
        console.log("Shutting down the home theater...");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `AsyncHomeTheaterFacade` class handles asynchronous operations using `async` and `await`, providing a smooth and responsive experience for the client.

### Integrating the Facade Pattern into Larger Applications

In larger applications, the Facade Pattern can be used to simplify interactions with complex subsystems. By providing a unified interface, the Facade Pattern reduces dependencies and promotes loose coupling between the client and the subsystem.

#### Using Generics for Flexibility

TypeScript's generics can be used to create flexible Facade implementations that can work with different types of subsystems.

```typescript
interface Device {
    on(): void;
    off(): void;
}

class GenericFacade<T extends Device> {
    private device: T;

    constructor(device: T) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public start(): void {
        this.device.on();
    }

    public stop(): void {
        this.device.off();
    }
}

class Light implements Device {
    on() {
        console.log("Light is on.");
    }

    off() {
        console.log("Light is off.");
    }
}

const light = new Light();
const lightFacade = new GenericFacade(light);
lightFacade.start();
lightFacade.stop();
```

In this example, the `GenericFacade` class can work with any device that implements the `Device` interface, providing a flexible and reusable solution.

### Documenting the Facade's API

Clear documentation is essential for any API, including a Facade. By documenting the Facade's methods and expected behavior, we make it easier for clients to use the Facade effectively.

#### Example Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * Interface for a simple home theater system.
 */
interface HomeTheaterFacade {
    /**
     * Starts the movie experience by turning on the necessary components.
     */
    watchMovie(): void;

    /**
     * Ends the movie experience by shutting down the components.
     */
    endMovie(): void;
}
```

### Testing the Facade

Unit testing is crucial to ensure the reliability of the Facade. TypeScript's type definitions make it easier to write tests by providing clear expectations for method inputs and outputs.

#### Example Unit Test

```typescript
import { SimpleHomeTheaterFacade } from './SimpleHomeTheaterFacade';
import { DVDPlayer, Amplifier, Projector } from './Subsystems';

describe('SimpleHomeTheaterFacade', () => {
    let dvdPlayer: DVDPlayer;
    let amplifier: Amplifier;
    let projector: Projector;
    let facade: SimpleHomeTheaterFacade;

    beforeEach(() => {
        dvdPlayer = new DVDPlayer();
        amplifier = new Amplifier();
        projector = new Projector();
        facade = new SimpleHomeTheaterFacade(dvdPlayer, amplifier, projector);
    });

    it('should start the movie', () => {
        facade.watchMovie();
        // Add assertions to verify the expected behavior
    });

    it('should end the movie', () => {
        facade.endMovie();
        // Add assertions to verify the expected behavior
    });
});
```

### Handling Changes in Subsystem Interfaces

Subsystem interfaces may change over time, requiring updates to the Facade. By isolating subsystem changes behind the Facade, we minimize the impact on clients.

#### Strategies for Handling Changes

- **Versioning**: Maintain different versions of the Facade to support backward compatibility.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Use the Adapter Pattern to adapt new subsystem interfaces to the existing Facade.

### Best Practices for Error Handling

Providing meaningful feedback to the client is essential for a good user experience. The Facade should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages.

#### Example Error Handling

```typescript
class EnhancedHomeTheaterFacade implements HomeTheaterFacade {
    // ...

    public watchMovie(): void {
        try {
            this.projector.turnOn();
            this.projector.setInput("DVD");
            this.amplifier.on();
            this.amplifier.setVolume(5);
            this.dvdPlayer.play();
            console.log("Enjoy your movie!");
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("An error occurred while starting the movie:", error);
        }
    }

    public endMovie(): void {
        try {
            this.dvdPlayer.stop();
            console.log("Shutting down the home theater...");
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("An error occurred while ending the movie:", error);
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

The Facade Pattern is a powerful tool for simplifying complex systems and improving code maintainability. By leveraging TypeScript's features such as interfaces, strong typing, and access modifiers, we can create robust and flexible Facade implementations. Whether you're dealing with synchronous or asynchronous operations, the Facade Pattern provides a clear and consistent interface for clients, reducing dependencies and promoting loose coupling.
