## 1.2.2 Inheritance

Inheritance is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing one class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another. This mechanism not only facilitates code reuse but also helps in establishing a natural hierarchy between classes. In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword, which signifies that a class is derived from another class.

### Understanding Inheritance

Inheritance is the process by which a new class, known as a subclass, acquires the properties and methods of an existing class, referred to as a superclass. This relationship forms the basis of the "is-a" relationship, where the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass.

#### The `extends` Keyword

In Java, the `extends` keyword is used to establish an inheritance relationship between two classes. The syntax is straightforward:

```java
class Superclass {
    // fields and methods
}

class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // additional fields and methods
}
```

In this example, `Subclass` inherits all the fields and methods from `Superclass`, allowing it to use and override them as needed.

### Superclass and Subclass Relationships

Consider a simple example to illustrate superclass and subclass relationships:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

In this scenario, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`. It inherits the `eat` method from `Animal` and adds its own method, `bark`.

### The "is-a" Relationship

The "is-a" relationship is central to understanding when inheritance is appropriate. It implies that the subclass is a specific type of the superclass. For example, a `Dog` is an `Animal`, which justifies the use of inheritance. However, misuse of this relationship can lead to inappropriate class hierarchies.

### Benefits of Code Reuse

One of the primary advantages of inheritance is code reuse. By inheriting from a superclass, a subclass can leverage existing code without rewriting it. This not only reduces redundancy but also enhances maintainability.

### Method Overriding and the `super` Keyword

Inheritance allows subclasses to override methods defined in the superclass. This is done by providing a new implementation for a method in the subclass. The `super` keyword is used to call the superclass's version of a method or constructor.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void eat() {
        super.eat(); // Calls the superclass method
        System.out.println("The dog eats dog food.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Dog` overrides the `eat` method but still calls the superclass's `eat` method using `super`.

### Potential Issues with Inheritance

Despite its benefits, inheritance can introduce challenges such as tight coupling and the fragile base class problem. Tight coupling occurs when subclasses are heavily dependent on the implementation details of their superclasses, making changes difficult. The fragile base class problem arises when changes to a superclass inadvertently affect its subclasses.

### Inheritance vs. Composition

Inheritance is often compared to composition, another fundamental OOP principle. While inheritance models an "is-a" relationship, composition models a "has-a" relationship, where a class contains instances of other classes.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts.");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car starts.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Car` has an `Engine`, illustrating composition.

#### When to Prefer Composition Over Inheritance

Composition is generally preferred over inheritance when:

- Classes do not share a natural "is-a" relationship.
- You want to avoid tight coupling.
- You need more flexibility in class design.

### Abstract Classes in Inheritance Hierarchies

Abstract classes play a crucial role in inheritance hierarchies. They provide a way to define common behavior for subclasses while preventing direct instantiation.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move();
}

class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void move() {
        System.out.println("The bicycle pedals forward.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Vehicle` is an abstract class with an abstract method `move`, which `Bicycle` must implement.

### Multiple Inheritance in Java

Java does not support multiple inheritance directly due to the complexity it introduces. However, interfaces provide a workaround by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck flies.");
    }

    @Override
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck swims.");
    }
}
```

In this example, `Duck` implements both `Flyable` and `Swimmable`, achieving multiple inheritance-like behavior.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Inheritance is integral to achieving polymorphism, where a single interface can represent different underlying forms (data types). This allows for dynamic method binding and enhances flexibility in code design.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Cat();
        myAnimal.makeSound(); // Outputs "Cat meows."
    }
}
```

In this example, `myAnimal` is an `Animal` reference but holds a `Cat` object, demonstrating polymorphism.

### Conclusion

Inheritance is a powerful tool in Java, enabling code reuse, establishing hierarchies, and supporting polymorphism. However, it requires careful design to avoid pitfalls such as tight coupling and the fragile base class problem. Understanding when to use inheritance and when to opt for composition is crucial for building robust applications.
