## 1.2.4 Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on highlighting the essential qualities of an object while concealing its complex details. In Java, abstraction is primarily achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces, which allow developers to define the structure and behavior of objects without delving into the specifics of their implementation.

### Defining Abstraction

At its core, abstraction is about simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into more manageable parts. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. This separation of concerns is crucial in managing complexity, enhancing code readability, and promoting reusability.

### Abstract Classes in Java

Abstract classes in Java serve as blueprints for other classes. They can include both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly; they must be subclassed, and the abstract methods must be implemented by the subclasses.

#### Example of an Abstract Class

```java
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void makeSound();

    // Concrete method
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Implementing the abstract method
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof
        dog.eat();       // Outputs: This animal is eating.
    }
}
```

In this example, `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `makeSound()` and a concrete method `eat()`. The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and provides an implementation for the `makeSound()` method.

### Interfaces in Java

Interfaces define a contract that classes can implement. They are purely abstract and do not contain any implementation (prior to Java 8). Interfaces allow for multiple inheritance, meaning a class can implement multiple interfaces.

#### Example of an Interface

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("This bird is flying.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird bird = new Bird();
        bird.fly(); // Outputs: This bird is flying.
    }
}
```

In this example, `Flyable` is an interface with a single method `fly()`. The `Bird` class implements this interface and provides the method's implementation.

### The `abstract` Keyword

The `abstract` keyword in Java is used to declare a class or method as abstract. An abstract class is declared using the `abstract` keyword before the class keyword, and an abstract method is declared without a body.

### Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces

1. **Implementation**: Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces (prior to Java 8) can only have abstract methods.
2. **Inheritance**: A class can extend only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.
3. **Constructors**: Abstract classes can have constructors, whereas interfaces cannot.
4. **Fields**: Abstract classes can have instance variables, while interfaces can only have constants (static final fields).

### When to Use Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces

- **Abstract Classes**: Use when you want to share code among several closely related classes. They are suitable when classes share a common base and some methods have a default implementation.
- **Interfaces**: Use when you want to define a contract for classes to implement, especially when unrelated classes need to implement the same methods. Interfaces are ideal for defining capabilities that can be added to any class.

### Real-World Scenarios of Abstraction

Abstraction is widely used in software development to manage complexity and improve system design. For example, consider a payment processing system:

```java
abstract class PaymentProcessor {
    public abstract void processPayment(double amount);

    public void printReceipt() {
        System.out.println("Receipt printed.");
    }
}

class CreditCardProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

class PayPalProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
    }
}
```

In this scenario, `PaymentProcessor` is an abstract class that provides a template for different payment methods. Each subclass implements the `processPayment()` method according to its specific requirements.

### Abstraction in API Design

Abstraction plays a crucial role in API design by hiding the implementation details from the end-users and exposing only the necessary functionalities. This approach ensures that the internal workings of the API can change without affecting the users, as long as the interface remains consistent.

### Hiding Implementation Details

Abstraction helps in hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is protected from unauthorized access and modification.

### Impact of Java 8+ Features

With the introduction of Java 8, interfaces can now have default methods, which provide a default implementation. This feature blurs the line between abstract classes and interfaces, allowing interfaces to have behavior.

#### Example of Default Methods

```java
interface Printable {
    default void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing...");
    }
}

class Document implements Printable {
    // Inherits the default print method
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.print(); // Outputs: Printing...
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Printable` interface has a default method `print()`, which the `Document` class inherits without needing to provide its own implementation.

### Managing Complexity with Abstraction

Abstraction simplifies complex systems by allowing developers to work with high-level concepts rather than low-level details. This simplification makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase.

### Conclusion

Abstraction is a powerful tool in Java that helps manage complexity, promote code reusability, and enhance system design. By understanding and applying abstraction through abstract classes and interfaces, developers can build robust and flexible applications.
