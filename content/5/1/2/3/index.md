## 1.2.3 Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. This ability to take on many forms is what makes polymorphism a powerful feature in Java, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code design.

### Understanding Polymorphism

In Java, polymorphism allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that invokes them. It can be broadly categorized into two types: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism.

#### Compile-Time Polymorphism: Method Overloading

Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods have the same name but differ in the type or number of their parameters. The method to be invoked is determined at compile time based on the method signature.

**Example of Method Overloading:**

```java
public class Calculator {

    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two double values
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Sum of two integers: " + calc.add(5, 10));
        System.out.println("Sum of three integers: " + calc.add(5, 10, 15));
        System.out.println("Sum of two doubles: " + calc.add(5.5, 10.5));
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add` method is overloaded to handle different types and numbers of parameters.

#### Runtime Polymorphism: Method Overriding

Runtime polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.

**Example of Method Overriding:**

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class TestPolymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks
        myCat.sound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}
```

Here, the `sound` method is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes, demonstrating polymorphism at runtime.

### Enhancing Flexibility with Polymorphism

Polymorphism enhances code flexibility by allowing a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). This is particularly useful in scenarios where the exact type of an object is not known until runtime, allowing for more generic and reusable code.

#### Interfaces and Abstract Classes

Interfaces and abstract classes play a crucial role in achieving polymorphism. They allow different classes to implement the same set of methods, ensuring a consistent interface while enabling diverse implementations.

**Example with Interfaces:**

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
    }
}

public class TestShapes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape myCircle = new Circle();
        Shape mySquare = new Square();

        myCircle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a Circle
        mySquare.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a Square
    }
}
```

### The Role of `instanceof` and Dynamic Method Dispatch

The `instanceof` operator is used to test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or interface. It is often used to ensure type safety before casting objects.

**Dynamic Method Dispatch:**

Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile time. This is the essence of runtime polymorphism in Java, allowing the JVM to determine the method implementation to execute based on the object's runtime type.

### Potential Pitfalls and Best Practices

While polymorphism is powerful, it can lead to unintended consequences such as unintended overriding. It's essential to follow best practices:

- **Use polymorphism to enhance code flexibility and maintainability.**
- **Avoid excessive use of `instanceof`, which can lead to code that is difficult to maintain.**
- **Ensure that overridden methods adhere to the contract defined by the superclass or interface.**

### Polymorphism in Design Patterns

Polymorphism is a key component in many design patterns. For example, the Strategy pattern uses polymorphism to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

**Example of Strategy Pattern:**

```java
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
    }
}

class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal.");
    }
}

public class ShoppingCart {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
        cart.checkout(100);

        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
        cart.checkout(200);
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism and the Open/Closed Principle

Polymorphism supports the Open/Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By using polymorphism, new functionality can be added by creating new subclasses or implementations without altering existing code.

### Conclusion

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Java that provides flexibility and reusability, enabling developers to write more generic and maintainable code. By understanding and applying polymorphism effectively, you can create robust applications that are easier to extend and maintain.
