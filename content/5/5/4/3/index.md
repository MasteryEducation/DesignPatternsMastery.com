## 5.4.3 Example: Custom Dependency Injection Framework

In this section, we will explore the creation of a simple yet effective Dependency Injection (DI) framework in Java using annotations and reflection. This exercise not only deepens your understanding of DI principles but also provides insight into how established frameworks like Spring and Guice operate under the hood.

### Understanding Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that facilitates loose coupling between classes by injecting dependencies from an external source rather than having the class create them. This promotes flexibility, testability, and maintainability.

### Building a Custom DI Framework

Let's build a custom DI framework step-by-step, focusing on key concepts such as annotations, reflection, and object lifecycle management.

#### Step 1: Define Custom Annotations

Annotations are a powerful way to provide metadata about your code. We'll define an `@Inject` annotation to mark fields or constructors for dependency injection.

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR, ElementType.FIELD})
public @interface Inject {
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement the DI Container

The `Container` class is responsible for scanning classes, managing object creation, and resolving dependencies.

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Container {
    private Map<Class<?>, Object> instances = new HashMap<>();

    public <T> T getInstance(Class<T> clazz) throws Exception {
        if (instances.containsKey(clazz)) {
            return clazz.cast(instances.get(clazz));
        }

        T instance = createInstance(clazz);
        instances.put(clazz, instance);
        return instance;
    }

    private <T> T createInstance(Class<T> clazz) throws Exception {
        Constructor<?>[] constructors = clazz.getDeclaredConstructors();
        for (Constructor<?> constructor : constructors) {
            if (constructor.isAnnotationPresent(Inject.class)) {
                return createInstanceWithConstructor(constructor);
            }
        }

        T instance = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
        injectFields(instance);
        return instance;
    }

    private <T> T createInstanceWithConstructor(Constructor<?> constructor) throws Exception {
        Class<?>[] parameterTypes = constructor.getParameterTypes();
        Object[] parameters = new Object[parameterTypes.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < parameterTypes.length; i++) {
            parameters[i] = getInstance(parameterTypes[i]);
        }

        constructor.setAccessible(true);
        return (T) constructor.newInstance(parameters);
    }

    private void injectFields(Object instance) throws Exception {
        Field[] fields = instance.getClass().getDeclaredFields();
        for (Field field : fields) {
            if (field.isAnnotationPresent(Inject.class)) {
                field.setAccessible(true);
                Object fieldInstance = getInstance(field.getType());
                field.set(instance, fieldInstance);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Demonstrate Dependency Injection

Here's how you can use the framework to inject dependencies at runtime.

```java
public class ServiceA {
    @Inject
    private ServiceB serviceB;

    public void execute() {
        serviceB.perform();
    }
}

public class ServiceB {
    public void perform() {
        System.out.println("ServiceB is performing an action.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Container container = new Container();
        ServiceA serviceA = container.getInstance(ServiceA.class);
        serviceA.execute();
    }
}
```

### Handling Singleton and Prototype Scopes

In a DI framework, managing object scopes is crucial. Singleton scope ensures a single instance per container, while prototype scope creates a new instance each time.

To handle these, you can extend the `Container` class to manage different scopes. For simplicity, our example uses singleton scope by default.

### Using Reflection for Dependency Injection

Reflection enables the framework to access private fields and invoke constructors dynamically. This flexibility is both powerful and risky, as it bypasses encapsulation.

#### Considerations for Circular Dependencies

Circular dependencies occur when two or more classes depend on each other, leading to infinite loops. To manage this, you can detect cycles during dependency resolution and throw an exception.

### Benefits of Annotations

Annotations simplify configuration by promoting convention over configuration. They make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Error Handling and Meaningful Messages

When injection fails, the framework should provide clear error messages to help diagnose issues. This can be achieved by catching exceptions and wrapping them in custom exceptions with detailed messages.

### Extending the Framework

To extend the framework, consider adding features like aspect-oriented programming (AOP) for cross-cutting concerns such as logging and transaction management.

### Testing the DI Framework

Testing the framework involves ensuring that dependencies are correctly injected and that the container behaves as expected. Use unit tests to verify these aspects.

### Security Implications

Reflection can pose security risks, such as unauthorized access to private fields. Mitigate these risks by restricting the classes and packages the container can scan.

### Documenting Usage and Limitations

Documenting the framework's usage and limitations is crucial for users. Provide clear guidelines on how to use annotations and configure the container.

### Comparing with Established Frameworks

While building a custom DI framework is educational, established frameworks like Spring and Guice offer robust features, community support, and extensive documentation. Consider the trade-offs between a custom solution and leveraging existing libraries.

### Learning Benefits

Building a DI framework enhances your understanding of DI principles, annotations, and reflection. It provides insight into the inner workings of popular frameworks and improves your problem-solving skills.

### Trade-offs

Custom solutions offer flexibility but require maintenance and lack community support. Established libraries provide reliability and features but may be overkill for simple applications.

## Conclusion

Creating a custom DI framework in Java using annotations and reflection is a rewarding exercise that deepens your understanding of dependency injection. While it may not replace established frameworks in production, it provides valuable insights into the design and implementation of DI systems.
