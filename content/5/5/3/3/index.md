## 5.3.3 Bridge Pattern in TypeScript

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. By using the Bridge Pattern, you can create flexible and scalable software architectures that are easier to maintain and extend. In this section, we'll explore how to implement the Bridge Pattern in TypeScript, leveraging the language's powerful features such as interfaces, abstract classes, and generics.

### Understanding the Bridge Pattern

Before diving into the implementation, let's clarify the key components of the Bridge Pattern:

- **Abstraction**: Defines the interface for the high-level control logic. It maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.
- **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the interface defined by Abstraction.
- **Implementor**: Defines the interface for the low-level control logic. It doesn't need to match the Abstraction's interface.
- **Concrete Implementor**: Implements the Implementor interface.

The Bridge Pattern allows you to separate the abstraction from the implementation, enabling them to evolve independently. This separation is particularly useful when dealing with complex systems that require multiple implementations for a single abstraction.

### Implementing the Bridge Pattern in TypeScript

TypeScript provides several features that make implementing the Bridge Pattern straightforward and robust. Let's explore a practical example to illustrate these concepts.

#### Step 1: Define Interfaces and Abstract Classes

We'll start by defining the interfaces and abstract classes that represent the core components of the Bridge Pattern.

```typescript
// Implementor Interface
interface Renderer {
  renderCircle(radius: number): void;
  renderSquare(side: number): void;
}

// Concrete Implementor A
class VectorRenderer implements Renderer {
  renderCircle(radius: number): void {
    console.log(`Rendering a circle with radius ${radius} using vector graphics.`);
  }

  renderSquare(side: number): void {
    console.log(`Rendering a square with side ${side} using vector graphics.`);
  }
}

// Concrete Implementor B
class RasterRenderer implements Renderer {
  renderCircle(radius: number): void {
    console.log(`Rendering a circle with radius ${radius} using raster graphics.`);
  }

  renderSquare(side: number): void {
    console.log(`Rendering a square with side ${side} using raster graphics.`);
  }
}

// Abstraction
abstract class Shape {
  protected renderer: Renderer;

  constructor(renderer: Renderer) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
  }

  abstract draw(): void;
}

// Refined Abstraction
class Circle extends Shape {
  private radius: number;

  constructor(renderer: Renderer, radius: number) {
    super(renderer);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.renderer.renderCircle(this.radius);
  }
}

// Refined Abstraction
class Square extends Shape {
  private side: number;

  constructor(renderer: Renderer, side: number) {
    super(renderer);
    this.side = side;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.renderer.renderSquare(this.side);
  }
}
```

In this example:

- **Renderer** is the Implementor interface, defining methods for rendering shapes.
- **VectorRenderer** and **RasterRenderer** are Concrete Implementors, providing specific implementations for rendering shapes.
- **Shape** is the Abstraction, maintaining a reference to a Renderer.
- **Circle** and **Square** are Refined Abstractions, extending the functionality of Shape.

#### Step 2: Utilize Generics for Flexibility

Generics in TypeScript allow you to create components that work with a variety of data types. By using generics, you can enhance the flexibility of your Bridge Pattern implementation.

```typescript
// Generic Renderer Interface
interface GenericRenderer<T> {
  renderShape(shape: T): void;
}

// Generic Concrete Implementor
class GenericVectorRenderer<T> implements GenericRenderer<T> {
  renderShape(shape: T): void {
    console.log(`Rendering shape using vector graphics: ${JSON.stringify(shape)}`);
  }
}

// Generic Abstraction
abstract class GenericShape<T> {
  protected renderer: GenericRenderer<T>;

  constructor(renderer: GenericRenderer<T>) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
  }

  abstract draw(): void;
}

// Generic Refined Abstraction
class GenericCircle extends GenericShape<{ radius: number }> {
  private radius: number;

  constructor(renderer: GenericRenderer<{ radius: number }>, radius: number) {
    super(renderer);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.renderer.renderShape({ radius: this.radius });
  }
}
```

By introducing generics, you can create more adaptable and reusable components, accommodating different data types or operations.

#### Step 3: Enforce Type Safety with TypeScript

TypeScript's type checking is a powerful tool for preventing mismatches between the abstraction and implementation. By defining strict interfaces and abstract classes, you ensure that all components adhere to the expected contracts.

Consider the following example:

```typescript
// Type-safe Renderer Interface
interface SafeRenderer {
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }): void;
}

// Safe Concrete Implementor
class SafeVectorRenderer implements SafeRenderer {
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }): void {
    console.log(`Rendering ${shape.type} with dimensions ${shape.dimensions.join(', ')} using vector graphics.`);
  }
}

// Safe Abstraction
abstract class SafeShape {
  protected renderer: SafeRenderer;

  constructor(renderer: SafeRenderer) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
  }

  abstract draw(): void;
}

// Safe Refined Abstraction
class SafeRectangle extends SafeShape {
  private width: number;
  private height: number;

  constructor(renderer: SafeRenderer, width: number, height: number) {
    super(renderer);
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.renderer.render({ type: 'rectangle', dimensions: [this.width, this.height] });
  }
}
```

In this example, the **SafeRenderer** interface enforces a specific structure for the shape parameter, ensuring type safety and preventing runtime errors.

### Handling Optional Methods and Overloading

In some cases, you may need to handle optional methods or method overloading in the Implementor interface. TypeScript provides several techniques to manage these scenarios.

#### Using Optional Parameters

You can define optional parameters in your interfaces to accommodate methods that may not always require certain arguments.

```typescript
interface FlexibleRenderer {
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }, color?: string): void;
}

class FlexibleVectorRenderer implements FlexibleRenderer {
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }, color: string = 'black'): void {
    console.log(`Rendering ${shape.type} with dimensions ${shape.dimensions.join(', ')} in ${color} using vector graphics.`);
  }
}
```

In this example, the **color** parameter is optional, allowing for flexible method calls.

#### Method Overloading

TypeScript supports method overloading, enabling you to define multiple method signatures for a single method.

```typescript
class OverloadedRenderer {
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }): void;
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }, color: string): void;
  render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }, color?: string): void {
    console.log(`Rendering ${shape.type} with dimensions ${shape.dimensions.join(', ')}${color ? ' in ' + color : ''} using overloaded method.`);
  }
}
```

Here, the **render** method is overloaded to support calls with or without a color parameter.

### Protecting Internal Details with Access Modifiers

Access modifiers in TypeScript allow you to control the visibility of class members, protecting internal details and enforcing encapsulation.

- **public**: Members are accessible from anywhere.
- **protected**: Members are accessible within the class and its subclasses.
- **private**: Members are accessible only within the class.

Consider the following example:

```typescript
abstract class EncapsulatedShape {
  protected renderer: Renderer;

  constructor(renderer: Renderer) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
  }

  abstract draw(): void;

  protected logDrawing(): void {
    console.log('Drawing shape...');
  }
}

class EncapsulatedCircle extends EncapsulatedShape {
  private radius: number;

  constructor(renderer: Renderer, radius: number) {
    super(renderer);
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.logDrawing();
    this.renderer.renderCircle(this.radius);
  }
}
```

In this example, the **logDrawing** method is protected, allowing it to be used within the class hierarchy but not accessible from outside.

### Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

Dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC) are key principles for creating flexible and testable code. By injecting dependencies, you decouple components and enhance modularity.

Consider the following example using a simple DI container:

```typescript
class DIContainer {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map();

  register<T>(name: string, service: T): void {
    this.services.set(name, service);
  }

  resolve<T>(name: string): T {
    return this.services.get(name);
  }
}

const container = new DIContainer();
container.register('vectorRenderer', new VectorRenderer());

const renderer = container.resolve<Renderer>('vectorRenderer');
const circle = new Circle(renderer, 5);
circle.draw();
```

In this example, the **DIContainer** class provides a simple mechanism for registering and resolving dependencies, promoting loose coupling and testability.

### Integrating the Bridge Pattern into TypeScript Applications

The Bridge Pattern is highly versatile and can be integrated into various TypeScript applications. Let's explore a practical scenario: building a cross-platform drawing tool.

#### Cross-Platform Drawing Tool Example

Imagine you're developing a drawing tool that supports both vector and raster graphics. The Bridge Pattern allows you to separate the drawing logic from the rendering logic, enabling seamless integration with different platforms.

```typescript
class DrawingTool {
  private shape: Shape;

  constructor(shape: Shape) {
    this.shape = shape;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.shape.draw();
  }
}

// Usage
const vectorRenderer = new VectorRenderer();
const rasterRenderer = new RasterRenderer();

const vectorCircle = new Circle(vectorRenderer, 10);
const rasterSquare = new Square(rasterRenderer, 20);

const drawingTool1 = new DrawingTool(vectorCircle);
const drawingTool2 = new DrawingTool(rasterSquare);

drawingTool1.draw(); // Renders a circle using vector graphics
drawingTool2.draw(); // Renders a square using raster graphics
```

This example demonstrates how the Bridge Pattern facilitates the development of a cross-platform drawing tool, allowing for easy switching between rendering technologies.

### Best Practices for Unit Testing

Unit testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and maintainability of your code. When implementing the Bridge Pattern, consider the following best practices:

- **Test Each Component Independently**: Write unit tests for each component (e.g., Renderer, Shape) to verify their individual behavior.
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocking frameworks to simulate dependencies, allowing you to test components in isolation.
- **Verify Interactions**: Ensure that interactions between components (e.g., Shape and Renderer) are tested to confirm correct behavior.
- **Use Dependency Injection**: Leverage dependency injection to easily swap out implementations during testing.

Here's an example of a unit test for the **Circle** class using Jest:

```typescript
import { Circle } from './Circle';
import { Renderer } from './Renderer';

describe('Circle', () => {
  it('should render a circle with the correct radius', () => {
    const mockRenderer: Renderer = {
      renderCircle: jest.fn(),
      renderSquare: jest.fn(),
    };

    const circle = new Circle(mockRenderer, 5);
    circle.draw();

    expect(mockRenderer.renderCircle).toHaveBeenCalledWith(5);
  });
});
```

### Addressing Inheritance Hierarchies

While the Bridge Pattern helps manage inheritance hierarchies, it's important to be mindful of potential pitfalls. TypeScript offers features to mitigate these issues:

- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: Use composition to combine behaviors rather than relying solely on inheritance.
- **Use Interfaces to Define Contracts**: Interfaces provide a flexible way to define contracts without imposing strict inheritance hierarchies.
- **Leverage TypeScript's Advanced Features**: Utilize union types, intersection types, and type guards to create flexible and type-safe designs.

### Organizing Code with Namespaces and Modules

Namespaces and modules in TypeScript help organize code logically, promoting maintainability and clarity.

- **Namespaces**: Use namespaces to group related components within a single file.
- **Modules**: Use modules to encapsulate components and expose only the necessary parts.

```typescript
// Namespace Example
namespace Shapes {
  export interface Renderer {
    render(shape: { type: string, dimensions: number[] }): void;
  }

  export class Circle {
    private renderer: Renderer;
    private radius: number;

    constructor(renderer: Renderer, radius: number) {
      this.renderer = renderer;
      this.radius = radius;
    }

    draw(): void {
      this.renderer.render({ type: 'circle', dimensions: [this.radius] });
    }
  }
}

// Module Example
export class Square {
  private renderer: Renderer;
  private side: number;

  constructor(renderer: Renderer, side: number) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
    this.side = side;
  }

  draw(): void {
    this.renderer.render({ type: 'square', dimensions: [this.side] });
  }
}
```

### Adhering to SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines that promote maintainable and scalable software. When implementing the Bridge Pattern, consider the following:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each class has a single responsibility, focusing on one aspect of the design.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Design components to be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Prefer smaller, specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions, to promote flexibility and testability.

### Leveraging TypeScript's Advanced Features

TypeScript offers several advanced features that can enhance your Bridge Pattern implementation:

- **Union Types**: Use union types to represent a value that can be one of several types.
- **Intersection Types**: Combine multiple types into one, allowing a value to satisfy multiple type constraints.
- **Type Guards**: Implement type guards to narrow down types within conditional blocks, ensuring type safety.

Consider the following example using union types and type guards:

```typescript
type ShapeType = 'circle' | 'square';

interface Shape {
  type: ShapeType;
  dimensions: number[];
}

function isCircle(shape: Shape): shape is { type: 'circle', dimensions: [number] } {
  return shape.type === 'circle';
}

function renderShape(shape: Shape): void {
  if (isCircle(shape)) {
    console.log(`Rendering a circle with radius ${shape.dimensions[0]}.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Rendering a square with side ${shape.dimensions[0]}.`);
  }
}
```
