### Setting Up a Testing Environment with Jest and TypeScript

To leverage Jest with TypeScript, you need to configure your environment to compile TypeScript code during testing. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest typescript
   ```

2. **Configure Jest**:

   Create a `jest.config.js` file:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'node',
   };
   ```

3. **Write Tests**:

   Create a test file, e.g., `sum.test.ts`:

   ```typescript
   function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
     return a + b;
   }

   test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
     expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
   });
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:

   Execute tests using the Jest CLI:

   ```bash
   npx jest
   ```

### Integration with Build Systems and CI/CD

Testing tools can be integrated into build systems and CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing process, ensuring that tests are run consistently and results are reported accurately.

- **Build Systems**: Tools like Webpack and Gulp can be configured to run tests as part of the build process, providing immediate feedback on code changes.

### Key Features of Testing Frameworks

#### Mocking

Mocking allows developers to simulate external dependencies, making it easier to test components in isolation. Jest provides built-in support for mocking, while Sinon.js is a popular standalone library for creating spies, stubs, and mocks.

- **Example with Jest**:

  ```typescript
  const mockFn = jest.fn();
  mockFn();
  expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();
  ```

- **Example with Sinon.js**:

  ```javascript
  const sinon = require('sinon');
  const spy = sinon.spy();

  spy();
  sinon.assert.calledOnce(spy);
  ```

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage analysis helps identify parts of the codebase that are not exercised by tests, providing insights into test suite completeness.

- **Jest**: Generates detailed code coverage reports out of the box.
- **Istanbul**: A popular tool for measuring code coverage, often used with Mocha.

#### Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing captures the output of a component and compares it to a saved snapshot, ensuring that changes are intentional.

- **Example with Jest**:

  ```typescript
  test('renders correctly', () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
    expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
  ```
