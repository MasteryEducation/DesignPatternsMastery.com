## 8.3.3 Algebraic Data Types

In the realm of functional programming, Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) play a pivotal role in creating robust and expressive data models. By leveraging ADTs, developers can precisely represent domain concepts and states, ensuring that invalid states are unrepresentable. In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of ADTs, explore their implementation in TypeScript, and examine their benefits in enhancing type safety and maintainability.

### Introduction to Algebraic Data Types

Algebraic Data Types are a cornerstone of functional programming languages, providing a powerful way to define complex data structures. They are composed of two primary types: sum types and product types. These types allow developers to model data in a way that aligns closely with the domain logic, promoting clarity and correctness.

#### Sum Types (Unions)

Sum types, also known as union types, represent a value that can be one of several possible types. They are akin to an "either-or" scenario, where a value can belong to one of many types, but not simultaneously. In TypeScript, union types are expressed using the `|` operator.

Example:
```typescript
type Shape = Circle | Square;

interface Circle {
  kind: 'circle';
  radius: number;
}

interface Square {
  kind: 'square';
  sideLength: number;
}
```

In the above example, `Shape` is a sum type that can be either a `Circle` or a `Square`. This allows for precise modeling of shapes, ensuring that a shape is always one of the defined types.

#### Product Types (Tuples and Records)

Product types, on the other hand, represent a combination of several types. They are akin to an "and" scenario, where a value is composed of multiple components. In TypeScript, product types are often expressed using tuples or interfaces.

Example:
```typescript
type Point = [number, number]; // Tuple

interface Rectangle {
  width: number;
  height: number;
} // Record
```

Here, `Point` is a product type represented by a tuple, combining two numbers. `Rectangle` is another product type, represented by an interface with `width` and `height` properties.

### Modeling Data with ADTs in TypeScript

Algebraic Data Types enable developers to model data structures that closely reflect the domain logic. By using TypeScript's union and tuple types, we can create expressive and type-safe models.

#### Discriminated Unions for Enhanced Type Safety

One of the most powerful features of TypeScript is discriminated unions, which enhance type safety by tagging each variant with a unique identifier. This allows the TypeScript compiler to narrow down types based on the value of a discriminant property.

Example:
```typescript
type Vehicle = Car | Truck;

interface Car {
  type: 'car';
  make: string;
  model: string;
}

interface Truck {
  type: 'truck';
  capacity: number;
}

function getVehicleInfo(vehicle: Vehicle) {
  switch (vehicle.type) {
    case 'car':
      return `Car: ${vehicle.make} ${vehicle.model}`;
    case 'truck':
      return `Truck with capacity: ${vehicle.capacity}`;
    default:
      return 'Unknown vehicle';
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` type is a discriminated union, with `type` as the discriminant property. The `getVehicleInfo` function uses a switch statement to handle each variant, ensuring that all possible cases are covered.

#### Type Guards and Exhaustive Checks

Type guards and exhaustive checks are essential tools when working with ADTs. They ensure that all possible cases are handled, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

Example:
```typescript
function isCar(vehicle: Vehicle): vehicle is Car {
  return vehicle.type === 'car';
}

function processVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle) {
  if (isCar(vehicle)) {
    console.log(`Processing car: ${vehicle.make} ${vehicle.model}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Processing truck with capacity: ${vehicle.capacity}`);
  }
}
```

The `isCar` function is a type guard that checks if a `Vehicle` is a `Car`. This allows for safe type narrowing within the `processVehicle` function.

### Patterns for Handling Optionality and Errors

ADTs are particularly useful for handling optionality and errors, providing a structured way to represent these concepts.

#### Option/Maybe Pattern

The `Option` or `Maybe` pattern is used to represent values that may or may not be present. This pattern is commonly used to avoid null or undefined values, which can lead to runtime errors.

Example:
```typescript
type Option<T> = Some<T> | None;

interface Some<T> {
  type: 'some';
  value: T;
}

interface None {
  type: 'none';
}

function getValue<T>(option: Option<T>): T | null {
  switch (option.type) {
    case 'some':
      return option.value;
    case 'none':
      return null;
  }
}
```

In this example, `Option<T>` is an ADT that can be either `Some<T>`, representing a present value, or `None`, representing the absence of a value.

#### Either Pattern

The `Either` pattern is used to handle computations that may result in a value or an error. It is a versatile pattern that can represent success or failure states.

Example:
```typescript
type Either<L, R> = Left<L> | Right<R>;

interface Left<L> {
  type: 'left';
  value: L;
}

interface Right<R> {
  type: 'right';
  value: R;
}

function handleResult<L, R>(result: Either<L, R>) {
  switch (result.type) {
    case 'left':
      console.error(`Error: ${result.value}`);
      break;
    case 'right':
      console.log(`Success: ${result.value}`);
      break;
  }
}
```

Here, `Either<L, R>` is an ADT that can be `Left<L>`, representing an error, or `Right<R>`, representing a successful result.

### Implementing ADTs with Libraries

TypeScript's type system, while powerful, has limitations when it comes to representing certain ADTs. Libraries like `fp-ts` provide additional tools and abstractions for working with ADTs in a functional programming style.

#### Using `fp-ts` for ADTs

`fp-ts` is a popular library that offers a wide range of functional programming utilities, including ADTs like `Option` and `Either`.

Example:
```typescript
import { Option, some, none, isSome } from 'fp-ts/lib/Option';

const value: Option<number> = some(42);

if (isSome(value)) {
  console.log(`Value is: ${value.value}`);
} else {
  console.log('No value present');
}
```

In this example, `fp-ts` provides a robust implementation of the `Option` type, along with utility functions for working with it.

### Benefits of ADTs in Domain Modeling

Algebraic Data Types offer numerous benefits in domain modeling, including:

- **Type Safety**: ADTs enforce type safety, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- **Expressiveness**: ADTs allow for precise modeling of domain concepts, making the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Invalid State Representation**: By design, ADTs make it difficult to represent invalid states, reducing bugs and improving reliability.

### Challenges and Limitations

Despite their benefits, representing certain ADTs in TypeScript can be challenging due to type system limitations. For instance, TypeScript lacks built-in support for pattern matching, a common feature in functional programming languages. However, developers can simulate pattern matching using switch statements and type guards.

### Designing Data Models with ADTs

When designing data models with ADTs, consider the following tips:

- **Start with the Domain**: Focus on the domain concepts and states you need to represent.
- **Use Discriminated Unions**: Leverage discriminated unions for enhanced type safety and clarity.
- **Organize Definitions**: Keep ADT definitions organized, especially in larger projects, to maintain scalability and readability.

### Safe Refactoring and Code Evolution

ADTs facilitate safe refactoring and code evolution by providing a clear and type-safe structure for data models. When changes are needed, the TypeScript compiler can help identify areas that require updates, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

### Exercises

To practice creating and using ADTs in TypeScript, try the following exercises:

1. **Model a Traffic Light System**: Create an ADT to represent the states of a traffic light (e.g., red, yellow, green) and implement a function that transitions between states.

2. **Implement a Simple Calculator**: Use ADTs to model operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and implement a function that evaluates expressions.

3. **Create a Form Validation System**: Model form fields using ADTs to represent valid and invalid states, and implement a function that validates form data.

### Conclusion

Algebraic Data Types are a powerful tool in the functional programming toolkit, enabling precise and type-safe domain modeling. By leveraging ADTs, developers can create robust and maintainable codebases that are resilient to bugs and easy to evolve. As you explore ADTs in TypeScript, remember to focus on the domain concepts and embrace the expressiveness and safety that ADTs provide.
