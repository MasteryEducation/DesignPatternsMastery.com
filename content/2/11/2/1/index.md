## 11.2.1 Practical Applications and Examples

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must exhibit different behaviors based on its current state. To illustrate this, let's delve into a practical example involving a document editor application. We'll explore how the State Pattern can manage different document states, such as editing, reviewing, and finalized.

### Document Editor Example

Imagine a document editor that supports three primary states: **Editing**, **Reviewing**, and **Finalized**. Each state allows the document to perform different actions:

- **Editing**: The document can be modified and saved.
- **Reviewing**: The document can be annotated and commented on but not modified.
- **Finalized**: The document is read-only and can be published.

#### How the Document (Context) Changes Based on State

In this example, the `Document` class acts as the **Context**. It maintains a reference to an instance of a `State` interface, which defines the methods `edit()`, `review()`, and `publish()`. The `Document` class delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object. The available actions depend on the current state, enabling the document to change behavior dynamically.

#### Implementing the State Interface

The `State` interface defines the actions that a document can perform:

```java
public interface State {
    void edit(Document document);
    void review(Document document);
    void publish(Document document);
}
```

#### Concrete State Classes

Each state of the document is represented by a **Concrete State Class** that implements the `State` interface. These classes define state-specific behaviors.

1. **EditingState**:

```java
public class EditingState implements State {
    @Override
    public void edit(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Editing the document.");
        // Logic for editing the document
    }

    @Override
    public void review(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Switching to review mode.");
        document.setState(new ReviewingState());
    }

    @Override
    public void publish(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Cannot publish while editing.");
    }
}
```

2. **ReviewingState**:

```java
public class ReviewingState implements State {
    @Override
    public void edit(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Cannot edit while reviewing.");
    }

    @Override
    public void review(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Reviewing the document.");
        // Logic for reviewing the document
    }

    @Override
    public void publish(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Finalizing the document.");
        document.setState(new FinalizedState());
    }
}
```

3. **FinalizedState**:

```java
public class FinalizedState implements State {
    @Override
    public void edit(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Cannot edit a finalized document.");
    }

    @Override
    public void review(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Cannot review a finalized document.");
    }

    @Override
    public void publish(Document document) {
        System.out.println("Publishing the document.");
        // Logic for publishing the document
    }
}
```

#### State Transitions

State transitions occur when the `Document` changes its state. For example, moving from `EditingState` to `ReviewingState` is triggered by the `review()` method in the `EditingState` class. This transition is managed by the `Document` class, which updates its current state reference.

#### Code Example

Here's how the `Document` class might look:

```java
public class Document {
    private State state;

    public Document() {
        state = new EditingState(); // Initial state
    }

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void edit() {
        state.edit(this);
    }

    public void review() {
        state.review(this);
    }

    public void publish() {
        state.publish(this);
    }
}
```

#### Best Practices and Considerations

- **Avoid Duplication**: Ensure that logic specific to each state is encapsulated within its respective state class, avoiding duplication across classes.
- **Safe Transitions**: Manage state transitions carefully to ensure they occur only when valid. This can prevent unexpected behavior and errors.
- **Delegation**: The `Document` class delegates state transition logic to state classes, simplifying the context and reducing coupling between states.
- **Thorough Testing**: Test each state thoroughly to ensure correct behavior and transitions, especially when adding new states.
- **Documentation**: Document states and transitions clearly to maintain an understanding of the system's behavior and facilitate future maintenance.

#### Potential Challenges

One potential challenge is ensuring that all possible states and transitions are accounted for. Missing a state or transition can lead to incomplete functionality or errors. Additionally, as the application evolves, new states may be required. The State Pattern can be extended to accommodate additional states by adding new concrete state classes and updating the context accordingly.

### Conclusion

The State Pattern provides a robust framework for managing an object's behavior based on its state. In the document editor example, it enables the document to change its actions dynamically, depending on whether it's in editing, reviewing, or finalized mode. By encapsulating state-specific behavior within concrete state classes, the pattern promotes clean, maintainable code and simplifies the management of complex state transitions.

The key takeaway is the importance of understanding how state affects behavior and ensuring that transitions are handled predictably and safely. By applying the State Pattern thoughtfully, developers can create flexible and scalable systems that adapt seamlessly to changing requirements.
