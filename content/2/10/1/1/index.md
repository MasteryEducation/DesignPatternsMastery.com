## 10.1.1 Defining an Algorithm's Skeleton

In the realm of software architecture, the Template Method pattern stands out as a quintessential example of how design patterns can elegantly solve common problems. This behavioral pattern is all about defining the skeleton of an algorithm within a method, while allowing subclasses the flexibility to redefine specific steps without altering the overall algorithm's structure. Let's delve into the intricacies of the Template Method pattern, exploring its components, benefits, and practical applications.

### Understanding the Template Method Pattern

At its core, the Template Method pattern is a strategy for defining the outline of an algorithm in a base class, known as the abstract class, while deferring the implementation of certain steps to subclasses. This approach ensures that the overarching structure of the algorithm remains consistent, while allowing for customization where needed.

#### Key Components

1. **Abstract Class**: This is where the template method resides. The template method outlines the algorithm's skeleton, calling various abstract methods that subclasses will implement.

2. **Template Method**: This method defines the sequence of steps in the algorithm. It is typically a `final` method, meaning it cannot be overridden by subclasses, ensuring the algorithm's structure remains intact.

3. **Concrete Subclasses**: These subclasses inherit from the abstract class and provide specific implementations for the abstract methods defined in the template method.

### How It Works: A Simple Example

Imagine a scenario where we need to process data from different sources, such as files, databases, or web services. The overall steps for processing might include opening the data source, reading the data, processing the data, and finally closing the data source. The Template Method pattern allows us to define this skeleton in an abstract class, while concrete subclasses handle the specifics of each step for different data sources.

```java
abstract class DataProcessor {
    // Template method
    public final void process() {
        openSource();
        readData();
        processData();
        closeSource();
    }

    abstract void openSource();
    abstract void readData();
    abstract void processData();
    abstract void closeSource();
}

class FileDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    void openSource() { /* Open file logic */ }
    void readData() { /* Read file data */ }
    void processData() { /* Process file data */ }
    void closeSource() { /* Close file */ }
}

class DatabaseDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    void openSource() { /* Connect to database */ }
    void readData() { /* Fetch data from database */ }
    void processData() { /* Process database data */ }
    void closeSource() { /* Disconnect database */ }
}
```

### Promoting Code Reuse

The Template Method pattern promotes code reuse by encapsulating the invariant parts of the algorithm in the abstract class. This means that any changes to the algorithm's structure only need to be made in one place, rather than across multiple subclasses. This encapsulation also adheres to the **Hollywood Principle**: "Don't call us; we'll call you." The abstract class controls the algorithm's flow, calling the necessary methods in subclasses as needed.

### Supporting the Open/Closed Principle

One of the significant advantages of the Template Method pattern is its alignment with the **Open/Closed Principle**. This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By allowing subclasses to implement specific steps, the pattern enables extensions without requiring changes to the algorithm's structure.

### Practical Applications

The Template Method pattern finds applications in various domains:

- **Game AI**: Defining a sequence of moves or actions for a game character, where specific actions vary based on the character type.
- **Network Protocols**: Implementing protocols where the sequence of operations is fixed, but specific actions (like authentication) can vary.
- **Data Processing**: As demonstrated earlier, processing data from different sources while maintaining a consistent workflow.

### Diagram Illustration

Here's a simple UML diagram illustrating the Template Method pattern:

```
+------------------+
|  DataProcessor   |  <--- Abstract Class
+------------------+
| - process()      |  <--- Template Method
| - openSource()   |  <--- Abstract Method
| - readData()     |
| - processData()  |
| - closeSource()  |
+------------------+
         |
         | Inheritance
         |
+--------------------+        +----------------------+
| FileDataProcessor  |        | DatabaseDataProcessor |
+--------------------+        +----------------------+
| + openSource()     |        | + openSource()       |
| + readData()       |        | + readData()         |
| + processData()    |        | + processData()      |
| + closeSource()    |        | + closeSource()      |
+--------------------+        +----------------------+
```

### Method Naming and Hooks

Using clear and descriptive method names is crucial for conveying the algorithm's steps. Additionally, the pattern can include **hooks**â€”optional methods that subclasses can override to provide additional behavior or default implementations.

### Challenges and Considerations

While the Template Method pattern offers many benefits, it can also introduce rigidity. The fixed structure of the algorithm means that significant changes to the process may require altering the abstract class, potentially affecting all subclasses. Therefore, it's essential to carefully design the template method to balance flexibility and stability.

### When to Consider the Template Method Pattern

Consider using the Template Method pattern when you have a consistent process with steps that can be customized. It is particularly useful when you want to enforce a specific sequence of operations while allowing flexibility in certain parts.

### Conclusion

The Template Method pattern is a powerful tool in the software architect's toolkit, providing a balance between consistency and customization. By defining an algorithm's skeleton in an abstract class, it promotes code reuse, supports the Open/Closed Principle, and adheres to the Hollywood Principle. With its wide range of applications, the Template Method pattern is a go-to solution for scenarios requiring a structured yet flexible approach.
