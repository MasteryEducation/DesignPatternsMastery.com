## 16.1.2 Types of AI Systems and Their Characteristics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern software systems, offering capabilities that range from simple automation to complex decision-making processes. Understanding the types of AI systems and their characteristics is crucial for developers and engineers looking to integrate AI into their applications effectively. This section delves into the various types of AI systems, their characteristics, and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.

### Types of AI Systems

AI systems can be broadly categorized into several types, each with its unique characteristics and applications. The most common types include rule-based systems, probabilistic models, and neural networks. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different tasks and problem domains.

#### Rule-Based Systems

Rule-based systems are among the earliest forms of AI. They operate based on a set of predefined rules and logic to make decisions or solve problems. These systems are often used in expert systems, where they mimic the decision-making ability of a human expert.

- **Characteristics:**
  - **Deterministic:** Rule-based systems provide consistent outputs for given inputs, making them predictable.
