### Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming industries worldwide, offering unprecedented capabilities in data processing, decision-making, and automation. Understanding these technologies' fundamental concepts is crucial for integrating AI into modern software systems. This section will delve into the core principles of AI and ML, explore their differences, and discuss their applications, challenges, and integration strategies.

### Fundamental Concepts of AI and ML

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines designed to think and act like humans. These systems can perform tasks such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed for a specific task, and General AI, which possesses the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. ML models improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The three main types of ML are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
