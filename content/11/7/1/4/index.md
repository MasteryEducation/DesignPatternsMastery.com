## 7.1.4 Creating Custom Promise Utilities

In the realm of modern JavaScript and TypeScript development, promises have become a cornerstone for handling asynchronous operations. While the built-in capabilities of promises are robust, there are scenarios where custom utility functions can significantly enhance their functionality. This section delves into creating custom promise utilities that extend the capabilities of promises, making your asynchronous code more powerful and expressive.

### The Need for Custom Promise Utilities

Promises are versatile, but they aren't a one-size-fits-all solution. Custom promise utilities can help address specific needs such as timeouts, retries, and debouncing, which are common in real-world applications. By developing these utilities, you can:

- **Enhance Code Reusability**: Create utilities that can be reused across different projects, reducing code duplication.
- **Improve Readability**: Encapsulate complex asynchronous logic into well-named functions, making your code easier to understand.
- **Increase Robustness**: Handle edge cases and errors more effectively, leading to more reliable applications.

Let's explore some practical examples of custom promise utilities and how they can be implemented.

### Example 1: Implementing `promiseTimeout`

A common requirement in asynchronous programming is to ensure that a promise settles within a specific timeframe. If it doesn't, the operation should fail gracefully. This is where a `promiseTimeout` utility can be invaluable.

```javascript
/**
 * Wraps a promise with a timeout. If the promise doesn't settle within the specified time, it is rejected.
 * @param {Promise} promise - The promise to wrap.
 * @param {number} ms - The timeout in milliseconds.
 * @returns {Promise} - A promise that resolves or rejects based on the original promise or the timeout.
 */
function promiseTimeout(promise, ms) {
    let timeoutId;
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            reject(new Error('Promise timed out'));
        }, ms);
    });

    return Promise.race([promise, timeoutPromise])
        .finally(() => clearTimeout(timeoutId));
}

// Usage example
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('Data fetched'), 1000));
promiseTimeout(fetchData, 500)
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error); // Outputs: Error: Promise timed out
```

**Key Points:**
- **Race Condition**: `Promise.race()` is used to race the original promise against a timeout promise.
- **Cleanup**: `clearTimeout()` ensures that the timeout is cleared once the promise settles, preventing memory leaks.
- **Error Handling**: The utility provides a clear error message when the promise times out.

### Example 2: Creating a `retryPromise` Utility

Network requests and other asynchronous operations can fail due to transient errors. A `retryPromise` utility can automatically retry a promise-based operation a specified number of times before giving up.

```javascript
/**
 * Retries a promise-based function until it succeeds or the maximum number of attempts is reached.
 * @param {Function} fn - The function returning a promise to retry.
 * @param {number} retries - The maximum number of retries.
 * @param {number} delay - The delay between retries in milliseconds.
 * @returns {Promise} - A promise that resolves or rejects based on the operation success or failure.
 */
function retryPromise(fn, retries = 3, delay = 1000) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const attempt = (n) => {
            fn().then(resolve).catch((error) => {
                if (n === 0) {
                    reject(error);
                } else {
                    setTimeout(() => attempt(n - 1), delay);
                }
            });
        };
        attempt(retries);
    });
}

// Usage example
const unreliableFetch = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => Math.random() > 0.5 ? resolve('Success') : reject('Failure'));
retryPromise(unreliableFetch, 5, 500)
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
```

**Key Points:**
- **Retry Logic**: The function retries the operation using a recursive approach, decreasing the retry count with each attempt.
- **Delay Handling**: A delay between retries helps to avoid overwhelming the resource being accessed.
- **Parameterization**: Default values for retries and delay provide flexibility while ensuring usability.

### Example 3: Developing a `debouncePromise` Function

Debouncing is a technique used to limit how often a function can be called. This is particularly useful for operations like API requests triggered by user input.

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a debounced version of a function that returns a promise.
 * @param {Function} fn - The function to debounce.
 * @param {number} delay - The debounce delay in milliseconds.
 * @returns {Function} - A debounced function that returns a promise.
 */
function debouncePromise(fn, delay) {
    let timeoutId;
    return function (...args) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            if (timeoutId) {
                clearTimeout(timeoutId);
            }
            timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
                fn(...args).then(resolve).catch(reject);
            }, delay);
        });
    };
}

// Usage example
const fetchData = () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('Data fetched'), 300));
const debouncedFetchData = debouncePromise(fetchData, 500);

debouncedFetchData().then(console.log); // Outputs: Data fetched (after 500ms delay)
```

**Key Points:**
- **Debounce Mechanism**: The utility uses a timeout to delay function execution, resetting the timer on each call.
- **Promise Handling**: The debounced function returns a promise, maintaining the asynchronous nature of the original function.
- **Flexibility**: The utility can be used with any promise-returning function, making it highly reusable.

### Safely Cancelling Promises

While promises don't natively support cancellation, custom utilities can provide a mechanism to simulate cancellation. This involves using a flag or token to signal cancellation and handling it within the promise logic.

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a cancellable promise.
 * @param {Function} fn - The function that performs the asynchronous operation.
 * @returns {Object} - An object containing the promise and a cancel method.
 */
function cancellablePromise(fn) {
    let isCancelled = false;

    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fn().then((result) => {
            if (!isCancelled) {
                resolve(result);
            }
        }).catch((error) => {
            if (!isCancelled) {
                reject(error);
            }
        });
    });

    return {
        promise,
        cancel() {
            isCancelled = true;
        }
    };
}

// Usage example
const { promise, cancel } = cancellablePromise(() => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve('Done'), 1000)));

setTimeout(cancel, 500); // Cancels the promise after 500ms

promise.then(console.log).catch(console.error); // Promise is cancelled, so neither log nor error is called
```

**Key Points:**
- **Cancellation Flag**: A boolean flag is used to track the cancellation state.
- **Promise Logic**: The promise checks the cancellation flag before resolving or rejecting.
- **Limitations**: This approach doesn't stop the underlying operation, only the promise resolution.

### Handling Edge Cases and Errors

When developing custom promise utilities, it's crucial to handle edge cases and errors effectively. Consider scenarios such as:

- **Invalid Parameters**: Validate inputs and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Timeouts and Retries**: Ensure that timeouts and retries don't overlap or conflict.
- **Resource Management**: Clean up resources like timers to prevent memory leaks.

### Best Practices for Custom Promise Utilities

- **Parameter Validation**: Use default values and validate inputs to prevent runtime errors.
- **Documentation**: Write thorough documentation and comments to explain the utility's purpose and usage.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Leverage higher-order functions to create flexible and reusable utilities.
- **Integration**: Ensure that utilities integrate seamlessly with existing codebases.
- **Open Source**: Share useful utilities as open-source packages or within your development team.
- **Performance Optimization**: Consider performance implications and optimize the utility for efficiency.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests to verify the utility's behavior and reliability.

### Understanding Promise Mechanics

A deep understanding of promise mechanics is essential when designing custom utilities. This includes knowledge of:

- **Promise States**: Understanding pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.
- **Chaining and Composition**: How promises can be chained and composed for complex operations.
- **Error Propagation**: Handling errors and ensuring they propagate correctly through promise chains.

### Avoiding Anti-Patterns

When designing promise utilities, avoid common anti-patterns such as:

- **Callback Hell**: Avoid nesting promises unnecessarily, which can lead to complex and hard-to-read code.
- **Ignoring Errors**: Always handle errors and provide meaningful feedback.
- **Blocking Operations**: Ensure that utilities remain non-blocking and don't introduce performance bottlenecks.

### Continuous Learning and Improvement

Custom promise utilities should evolve based on real-world usage and feedback. Encourage continuous learning by:

- **Reviewing Feedback**: Gather feedback from users and iterate on the utility's design.
- **Exploring New Patterns**: Stay updated with the latest patterns and techniques in asynchronous programming.
- **Experimenting**: Test new ideas and approaches to improve utility functionality.

### Conclusion

Creating custom promise utilities in JavaScript and TypeScript can greatly enhance your ability to manage asynchronous operations. By understanding the mechanics of promises and following best practices, you can develop utilities that are robust, reusable, and easy to integrate into your projects. Whether it's implementing timeouts, retries, or debouncing, these utilities can make your code more expressive and reliable. Remember to document your utilities thoroughly, test them rigorously, and share them with the community to contribute to the broader ecosystem of asynchronous programming.
