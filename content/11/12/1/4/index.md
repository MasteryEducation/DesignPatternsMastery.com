- **Set Up Alerts:** Configure alerts for key performance metrics to detect anomalies or degradations.
- **Regularly Review Metrics:** Schedule regular reviews of performance data to identify trends and areas for improvement.

### User-Centric Metrics: Time to Interactive and Smoothness

User-centric metrics focus on the user's perception of performance. These metrics are crucial for understanding how users experience the application.

**Key User-Centric Metrics:**

- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Measures how quickly the page becomes interactive. A low TTI indicates a responsive and engaging user experience.
- **Smoothness:** Assesses the smoothness of animations and interactions, often measured in frames per second (FPS). High smoothness contributes to a seamless user experience.

### Translating Business Requirements into Technical Performance Goals

Business requirements often dictate the performance goals of an application. Translating these requirements into technical objectives ensures alignment between business and development teams.

**Steps to Translate Requirements:**

- **Identify Business Objectives:** Understand the key business goals, such as increasing conversion rates or improving user retention.
