## 1.3.4 Polymorphism and Inheritance

In the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism and inheritance stand as two fundamental pillars that enable developers to write more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. This section delves into these concepts, focusing on their implementation and application in JavaScript and TypeScript. We will explore how these languages support polymorphism through inheritance and interfaces, provide practical examples, and discuss best practices for leveraging these powerful features in your projects.

### Understanding Polymorphism

Polymorphism, derived from the Greek words "poly" (meaning many) and "morph" (meaning form), refers to the ability of different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In simpler terms, polymorphism allows objects of different types to be accessed through the same interface, enabling a single function to operate on different kinds of objects.

#### Role of Polymorphism in OOP

Polymorphism plays a crucial role in object-oriented programming by providing the following benefits:

- **Flexibility:** It allows for writing more generic and flexible code that can work with objects of different types.
- **Extensibility:** New classes can be introduced with minimal changes to existing code, supporting the open/closed principle of SOLID.
- **Maintainability:** It reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability by allowing the same operation to be performed in different ways.

### Polymorphism in JavaScript and TypeScript

JavaScript and TypeScript support polymorphism primarily through inheritance and interfaces, although their approaches differ slightly due to TypeScript's static typing capabilities.

#### Inheritance in JavaScript

JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript also supports class-based syntax, making it easier to implement inheritance.

Here's a basic example of inheritance in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Dog barks");
    }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
myDog.speak(); // Output: Dog barks
```

In this example, `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`, and it overrides the `speak` method to provide its specific implementation.

#### Inheritance in TypeScript

TypeScript builds upon JavaScript's inheritance model by adding static typing and interfaces, which enhance polymorphic behavior.

```typescript
class Animal {
    speak(): void {
        console.log("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak(): void {
        console.log("Dog barks");
    }
}

const myDog: Animal = new Dog();
myDog.speak(); // Output: Dog barks
```

TypeScript allows us to define the type of `myDog` as `Animal`, demonstrating polymorphism where a `Dog` object is treated as an `Animal`.

### Method Overriding and Runtime Method Binding

Method overriding is a key aspect of polymorphism, allowing a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is achieved through runtime method binding, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.

#### Example of Method Overriding

```typescript
class Vehicle {
    move(): void {
        console.log("Vehicle is moving");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    move(): void {
        console.log("Car is driving");
    }
}

const myCar: Vehicle = new Car();
myCar.move(); // Output: Car is driving
```

In this example, the `move` method in `Car` overrides the `move` method in `Vehicle`, and the correct method is invoked at runtime.

### Base Classes and Derived Classes

Base classes (or superclasses) provide common functionality that can be inherited by derived classes (or subclasses). This hierarchical relationship is central to achieving polymorphic behavior.

#### Benefits of Using Base and Derived Classes

- **Code Reusability:** Common code is written once in the base class and reused by derived classes.
- **Abstraction:** Base classes can define abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes, enforcing a contract.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows treating derived class instances as instances of the base class, enabling polymorphic behavior.

### Interfaces and Polymorphism

While inheritance is a common way to achieve polymorphism, TypeScript offers interfaces as an alternative. Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to, enabling polymorphism without a strict inheritance hierarchy.

#### Using Interfaces for Polymorphism

```typescript
interface Flyable {
    fly(): void;
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    fly(): void {
        console.log("Bird is flying");
    }
}

class Airplane implements Flyable {
    fly(): void {
        console.log("Airplane is flying");
    }
}

function letItFly(flyable: Flyable) {
    flyable.fly();
}

const bird = new Bird();
const airplane = new Airplane();

letItFly(bird);      // Output: Bird is flying
letItFly(airplane);  // Output: Airplane is flying
```

In this example, both `Bird` and `Airplane` implement the `Flyable` interface, allowing them to be used interchangeably in the `letItFly` function.

### Method Overloading in TypeScript

Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. While JavaScript does not support method overloading directly, TypeScript provides a way to define overloaded methods using type annotations.

#### Example of Method Overloading

```typescript
class Calculator {
    add(a: number, b: number): number;
    add(a: string, b: string): string;
    add(a: any, b: any): any {
        return a + b;
    }
}

const calculator = new Calculator();
console.log(calculator.add(5, 10));       // Output: 15
console.log(calculator.add("Hello, ", "World!")); // Output: Hello, World!
```

TypeScript allows defining multiple signatures for the `add` method, enabling different behaviors based on input types.

### Designing Maintainable Class Hierarchies

When designing class hierarchies, it's essential to follow best practices to ensure maintainability and scalability.

#### Best Practices for Class Hierarchies

- **Favor Composition Over Inheritance:** Use composition to combine objects rather than relying solely on inheritance, which can lead to rigid hierarchies.
- **Apply SOLID Principles:** Ensure your design adheres to SOLID principles, such as the single responsibility principle and the open/closed principle.
- **Use Interfaces Wisely:** Leverage interfaces to define contracts and achieve polymorphism without deep inheritance chains.

### Polymorphic Collections

Polymorphic collections allow storing different types of objects that share a common interface or base class, enabling flexible operations on heterogeneous collections.

#### Example of a Polymorphic Collection

```typescript
class Shape {
    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a square");
    }
}

const shapes: Shape[] = [new Circle(), new Square()];

shapes.forEach(shape => shape.draw());
// Output:
// Drawing a circle
// Drawing a square
```

### Testing and Mock Implementations

Polymorphism significantly impacts testing, allowing for mock implementations and easier testing of components in isolation.

#### Benefits of Polymorphism in Testing

- **Mocking and Stubbing:** Interfaces and base classes enable the creation of mock objects for testing purposes.
- **Isolation:** Polymorphic behavior allows testing components in isolation by substituting dependencies with mock implementations.

### Best Practices for Using Polymorphism

To effectively use polymorphism in your projects, consider the following best practices:

- **Keep Hierarchies Shallow:** Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies that can become difficult to manage.
- **Use Interfaces for Flexibility:** Prefer interfaces to define contracts, enabling more flexible and interchangeable code.
- **Encourage Extensibility:** Design your classes and interfaces to be easily extended without modifying existing code.

### Exercises for Practicing Polymorphic Behaviors

1. **Implement a Polymorphic Animal Hierarchy:** Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound`, and derive classes `Cat`, `Dog`, and `Cow` that override `makeSound` with specific implementations.
   
2. **Design an Interface for Vehicles:** Define an interface `Vehicle` with a method `move`, and implement classes `Bicycle`, `Car`, and `Boat` that adhere to this interface.

3. **Create a Polymorphic Collection:** Implement a collection of `Shape` objects, including `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`, and write a function to draw each shape.

4. **Test with Mock Implementations:** Use interfaces to create mock implementations of a service for testing purposes, ensuring your tests can run independently of actual service dependencies.

By understanding and applying polymorphism and inheritance effectively, you can design systems that are not only robust and scalable but also flexible and easy to maintain. Embrace these concepts to elevate your software design and development practices.
