## 5.1.3 Composite Pattern in TypeScript

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that enables you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In TypeScript, the Composite Pattern leverages interfaces and classes to enforce type safety and consistency across components, ensuring that complex structures can be managed effectively.

### Understanding the Composite Pattern

The Composite Pattern is particularly useful when you need to work with hierarchical data structures, such as file systems, organizational charts, or UI component trees. The pattern consists of the following key participants:

- **Component**: An interface or abstract class that declares the common operations for both simple and complex objects of the composition.
- **Leaf**: Represents the end objects of a composition. A leaf cannot have any children.
- **Composite**: A class that can contain other objects (both leaves and other composites). It implements the component interface and defines child-related operations.

### Implementing the Composite Pattern in TypeScript

Let's delve into a detailed implementation of the Composite Pattern in TypeScript, showcasing how to define components, leaves, and composites using interfaces and classes.

#### Defining the Component Interface

In TypeScript, you can define a `Component` interface that declares the operations that all concrete components must implement. This ensures that both `Leaf` and `Composite` classes adhere to a common structure.

```typescript
interface Graphic {
    draw(): void;
    add?(graphic: Graphic): void;
    remove?(graphic: Graphic): void;
    getChild?(index: number): Graphic | undefined;
}
```

In this example, the `Graphic` interface declares a `draw` method common to all graphics. The `add`, `remove`, and `getChild` methods are optional, as they are only relevant for composite objects.

#### Implementing the Leaf Class

The `Leaf` class represents the basic elements of the composition that do not have any children.

```typescript
class Circle implements Graphic {
    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a circle");
    }
}
```

Here, the `Circle` class implements the `Graphic` interface and provides its own implementation of the `draw` method.

#### Implementing the Composite Class

The `Composite` class can contain both leaves and other composites, providing implementations for managing child components.

```typescript
class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
    private children: Graphic[] = [];

    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a composite graphic");
        for (const child of this.children) {
            child.draw();
        }
    }

    add(graphic: Graphic): void {
        this.children.push(graphic);
    }

    remove(graphic: Graphic): void {
        const index = this.children.indexOf(graphic);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this.children.splice(index, 1);
        }
    }

    getChild(index: number): Graphic | undefined {
        return this.children[index];
    }
}
```

In this example, `CompositeGraphic` implements the `Graphic` interface and manages its children through an array. It provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve child components.

### Handling Generics in Composite Pattern

When working with components that operate on data of different types, you can use TypeScript generics to ensure type safety across the composite structure.

```typescript
interface Graphic<T> {
    draw(data: T): void;
    add?(graphic: Graphic<T>): void;
    remove?(graphic: Graphic<T>): void;
    getChild?(index: number): Graphic<T> | undefined;
}

class Circle<T> implements Graphic<T> {
    draw(data: T): void {
        console.log(`Drawing a circle with data: ${data}`);
    }
}

class CompositeGraphic<T> implements Graphic<T> {
    private children: Graphic<T>[] = [];

    draw(data: T): void {
        console.log("Drawing a composite graphic");
        for (const child of this.children) {
            child.draw(data);
        }
    }

    add(graphic: Graphic<T>): void {
        this.children.push(graphic);
    }

    remove(graphic: Graphic<T>): void {
        const index = this.children.indexOf(graphic);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this.children.splice(index, 1);
        }
    }

    getChild(index: number): Graphic<T> | undefined {
        return this.children[index];
    }
}
```

In this generic implementation, the `Graphic` interface and its implementations use a type parameter `T` to operate on data of different types, providing flexibility and type safety.

### Enforcing Consistent Method Signatures

TypeScript's strong typing system ensures that all components adhere to consistent method signatures, as defined by the `Component` interface. This prevents runtime errors and enhances code reliability.

### Managing Parent References

In some scenarios, you may need to traverse upwards in the hierarchy. You can manage parent references within each component to facilitate this traversal.

```typescript
interface Graphic {
    draw(): void;
    setParent?(parent: Graphic): void;
    getParent?(): Graphic | null;
}

class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
    private children: Graphic[] = [];
    private parent: Graphic | null = null;

    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a composite graphic");
        for (const child of this.children) {
            child.draw();
        }
    }

    add(graphic: Graphic): void {
        this.children.push(graphic);
        graphic.setParent?.(this);
    }

    remove(graphic: Graphic): void {
        const index = this.children.indexOf(graphic);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this.children.splice(index, 1);
            graphic.setParent?.(null);
        }
    }

    getChild(index: number): Graphic | undefined {
        return this.children[index];
    }

    setParent(parent: Graphic): void {
        this.parent = parent;
    }

    getParent(): Graphic | null {
        return this.parent;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, each `Graphic` can have a parent reference, allowing you to traverse upwards in the hierarchy if needed.

### Implementing Type Guards and Discriminated Unions

Type guards and discriminated unions can be useful for distinguishing between different types of components within the composite structure.

```typescript
type GraphicType = "circle" | "composite";

interface Graphic {
    type: GraphicType;
    draw(): void;
}

function isCircle(graphic: Graphic): graphic is Circle {
    return graphic.type === "circle";
}

class Circle implements Graphic {
    type: GraphicType = "circle";
    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic {
    type: GraphicType = "composite";
    private children: Graphic[] = [];

    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a composite graphic");
        for (const child of this.children) {
            child.draw();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Graphic` interface includes a `type` property, and the `isCircle` function acts as a type guard to determine if a `Graphic` is a `Circle`.

### Iterating Over Components

TypeScript's iterators can be used to iterate over components in a composite structure, providing a clean and efficient way to traverse the hierarchy.

```typescript
class CompositeGraphic implements Graphic, Iterable<Graphic> {
    private children: Graphic[] = [];

    draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a composite graphic");
        for (const child of this.children) {
            child.draw();
        }
    }

    add(graphic: Graphic): void {
        this.children.push(graphic);
    }

    [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<Graphic> {
        let index = 0;
        const children = this.children;

        return {
            next(): IteratorResult<Graphic> {
                if (index < children.length) {
                    return { value: children[index++], done: false };
                } else {
                    return { value: undefined, done: true };
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

By implementing the `Iterable` interface, `CompositeGraphic` can be used in a `for...of` loop, making it easy to iterate over its children.

### Documenting Component Behaviors

Documenting the behaviors and hierarchical relationships of components is crucial for maintaining and understanding complex composite structures. Use comments and documentation tools to provide clear explanations of each component's role and interactions.

### Integrating the Composite Pattern into Applications

Integrating the Composite Pattern into existing TypeScript applications involves identifying hierarchical structures and refactoring them to use the pattern. This can improve code organization, scalability, and maintainability.

#### Example: File System Representation

Consider a file system where directories can contain files and other directories. The Composite Pattern can be used to model this hierarchy.

```typescript
interface FileSystemEntity {
    name: string;
    display(indent: string): void;
}

class File implements FileSystemEntity {
    constructor(public name: string) {}

    display(indent: string): void {
        console.log(`${indent}- ${this.name}`);
    }
}

class Directory implements FileSystemEntity {
    private children: FileSystemEntity[] = [];

    constructor(public name: string) {}

    add(entity: FileSystemEntity): void {
        this.children.push(entity);
    }

    display(indent: string): void {
        console.log(`${indent}+ ${this.name}`);
        for (const child of this.children) {
            child.display(indent + "  ");
        }
    }
}

const root = new Directory("root");
const file1 = new File("file1.txt");
const file2 = new File("file2.txt");
const subdir = new Directory("subdir");

root.add(file1);
root.add(subdir);
subdir.add(file2);

root.display("");
```

In this example, `File` and `Directory` implement the `FileSystemEntity` interface, allowing them to be composed into a hierarchical file system structure.

### Considerations for Serializing Composite Structures

When serializing composite structures, consider the following:

- **Circular References**: Ensure that circular references are handled to avoid infinite loops during serialization.
- **Serialization Format**: Choose a format (e.g., JSON, XML) that supports hierarchical data.
- **Custom Serialization Logic**: Implement custom serialization and deserialization logic if needed to preserve the structure and relationships.

### Testing Strategies for TypeScript Composites

Testing composite structures involves verifying both individual components and their interactions within the hierarchy. Consider the following strategies:

- **Unit Testing**: Test each component independently to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interactions between components within the composite structure.
- **Mocking and Stubbing**: Use mocks and stubs to isolate components during testing.
- **Edge Cases**: Test edge cases such as empty composites, deeply nested structures, and invalid operations.

### Resolving Circular Dependencies

Circular dependencies can arise when components reference each other in a way that creates a loop. To resolve circular dependencies:

- **Decouple Components**: Use dependency injection or event-driven architecture to decouple components.
- **Refactor Code**: Identify and refactor code to break circular dependencies.
- **Use Lazy Initialization**: Delay the initialization of certain components to break the dependency chain.

### Conclusion

The Composite Pattern in TypeScript provides a powerful way to manage hierarchical structures in a type-safe and consistent manner. By leveraging interfaces, generics, and TypeScript's strong typing system, you can create flexible and maintainable composite structures. Whether you're modeling a file system, UI components, or organizational charts, the Composite Pattern can help you manage complexity and improve code organization.
