- **Code Reviews:** Conducting regular code reviews to identify and address security issues.
- **Continuous Learning:** Staying informed about emerging security threats and vulnerabilities.

Developers should be empowered with the tools and knowledge needed to build secure software.

### Defense in Depth and Layered Security

Defense in depth is a security strategy that involves implementing multiple layers of security measures. This approach ensures that if one layer is compromised, others remain in place to protect the system. Key components of a layered security strategy include:

- **Network Security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation.
- **Application Security:** Secure coding practices, application firewalls, and regular security testing.
- **Data Security:** Encryption, access controls, and data masking.

By layering security measures, organizations can better protect against a wide range of threats.

### Common Misconceptions About Security

Several misconceptions about security can hinder effective implementation:

- **Security is Solely the Responsibility of Security Teams:** Security is a shared responsibility that involves developers, operations, and management.
- **Security Measures Impede Performance:** While security measures can impact performance, they can be optimized to minimize this impact.
- **Security is a One-Time Effort:** Security requires ongoing attention and adaptation to new threats and vulnerabilities.

Addressing these misconceptions is essential for fostering a security-conscious culture.

### Fostering a Security-Conscious Culture
