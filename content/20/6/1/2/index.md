## 6.1.2 Common Messaging Patterns

In the realm of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), messaging patterns play a crucial role in defining how components communicate with each other. These patterns provide the backbone for designing scalable, resilient, and flexible systems. This section delves into several common messaging patterns, each serving distinct purposes and offering unique advantages. We'll explore these patterns, provide practical Java code examples, and discuss real-world applications to enhance your understanding.

### Point-to-Point (P2P) Messaging

The Point-to-Point (P2P) pattern is a straightforward messaging model where messages are sent to a specific queue and consumed by a single receiver. This pattern ensures direct communication between a producer and a consumer, making it ideal for scenarios where a message should be processed by only one component.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Exclusive Consumption:** Each message is consumed by only one receiver.
- **Queue-Based:** Messages are stored in a queue until a consumer retrieves them.
- **Direct Communication:** Facilitates direct interaction between producer and consumer.

**Java Example Using JMS:**

```java
import javax.jms.*;

public class PointToPointExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws JMSException {
        // ConnectionFactory and Queue setup
        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
        Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
        Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
        Queue queue = session.createQueue("exampleQueue");

        // Producer sends a message
        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);
        TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("Hello, Point-to-Point!");
        producer.send(message);

        // Consumer receives the message
        MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue);
        connection.start();
        TextMessage receivedMessage = (TextMessage) consumer.receive();
        System.out.println("Received: " + receivedMessage.getText());

        // Cleanup
        producer.close();
        consumer.close();
        session.close();
        connection.close();
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
The P2P pattern is commonly used in order processing systems where each order is processed by a single service instance to ensure consistency and avoid duplication.

### Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Messaging

The Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern is a powerful messaging model where messages are published to a topic and consumed by multiple subscribers. This pattern enables broadcast communication, allowing multiple components to react to the same event.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Broadcast Communication:** Messages are delivered to all subscribers.
- **Topic-Based:** Messages are published to a topic rather than a queue.
- **Decoupled Components:** Publishers and subscribers are loosely coupled.

**Java Example Using Apache Kafka:**

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.*;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.*;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PubSubExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Producer configuration
        Properties producerProps = new Properties();
        producerProps.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        producerProps.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        producerProps.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

        // Create a producer
        Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(producerProps);
        producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("exampleTopic", "Hello, Publish-Subscribe!"));
        producer.close();

        // Consumer configuration
        Properties consumerProps = new Properties();
        consumerProps.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        consumerProps.put("group.id", "exampleGroup");
        consumerProps.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        consumerProps.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");

        // Create a consumer
        Consumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(consumerProps);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("exampleTopic"));

        // Poll for new messages
        ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(1000);
        for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
            System.out.println("Received: " + record.value());
        }

        consumer.close();
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
The Pub/Sub pattern is widely used in event notification systems, such as sending updates to multiple user interfaces when a data change occurs.

### Request-Reply Messaging

The Request-Reply pattern is a synchronous communication model where a request message is sent, and a corresponding reply is awaited. This pattern facilitates interactive communication between components.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Synchronous Interaction:** The sender waits for a reply before proceeding.
- **Two-Way Communication:** Involves both request and response messages.
- **Stateful Interaction:** Often requires maintaining state between request and reply.

**Java Example Using Spring Boot and RabbitMQ:**

```java
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.RabbitTemplate;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.ConnectionFactory;
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.CachingConnectionFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class RequestReplyConfig {

    @Bean
    public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
        return new CachingConnectionFactory("localhost");
    }

    @Bean
    public RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        return new RabbitTemplate(connectionFactory);
    }
}

public class RequestReplyExample {

    private final RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

    public RequestReplyExample(RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate) {
        this.rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate;
    }

    public String sendRequest(String message) {
        return (String) rabbitTemplate.convertSendAndReceive("requestQueue", message);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RequestReplyExample example = new RequestReplyExample(new RequestReplyConfig().rabbitTemplate(new RequestReplyConfig().connectionFactory()));
        String response = example.sendRequest("Hello, Request-Reply!");
        System.out.println("Received reply: " + response);
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
Request-Reply is often used in service-to-service communication where a service needs to query another service for data and wait for a response.

### Competing Consumers

The Competing Consumers pattern involves multiple consumers competing to process messages from the same queue. This pattern enables load balancing and parallel processing, improving system throughput and resilience.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple consumers process messages concurrently.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes workload among consumers.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales by adding more consumers.

**Java Example Using JMS:**

```java
import javax.jms.*;

public class CompetingConsumersExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws JMSException {
        // ConnectionFactory and Queue setup
        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
        Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
        Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
        Queue queue = session.createQueue("competingQueue");

        // Create multiple consumers
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(queue);
            connection.start();
            new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    while (true) {
                        TextMessage message = (TextMessage) consumer.receive();
                        System.out.println("Consumer " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " received: " + message.getText());
                    }
                } catch (JMSException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }).start();
        }

        // Producer sends messages
        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("Message " + i);
            producer.send(message);
        }

        // Cleanup
        producer.close();
        session.close();
        connection.close();
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
Competing Consumers is ideal for processing tasks such as image processing or data transformation, where multiple instances can handle tasks in parallel.

### Message Routing

Message Routing involves directing messages to appropriate consumers based on their content or attributes. This pattern includes content-based routing and message filtering, ensuring that messages reach the right destination.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Content-Based Routing:** Routes messages based on content.
- **Message Filtering:** Filters messages to specific consumers.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Adapts to changing conditions and requirements.

**Java Example Using Spring Integration:**

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.integration.annotation.Router;
import org.springframework.integration.channel.DirectChannel;
import org.springframework.integration.core.MessageSelector;
import org.springframework.integration.router.MessageRouter;
import org.springframework.messaging.MessageChannel;
import org.springframework.messaging.support.MessageBuilder;

@Configuration
public class RoutingConfig {

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel inputChannel() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel outputChannel1() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageChannel outputChannel2() {
        return new DirectChannel();
    }

    @Router(inputChannel = "inputChannel")
    public MessageRouter router() {
        return message -> {
            String payload = (String) message.getPayload();
            if (payload.contains("TypeA")) {
                return "outputChannel1";
            } else {
                return "outputChannel2";
            }
        };
    }
}

public class RoutingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RoutingConfig config = new RoutingConfig();
        MessageChannel inputChannel = config.inputChannel();
        MessageChannel outputChannel1 = config.outputChannel1();
        MessageChannel outputChannel2 = config.outputChannel2();

        inputChannel.send(MessageBuilder.withPayload("TypeA Message").build());
        inputChannel.send(MessageBuilder.withPayload("TypeB Message").build());

        // Consumers would be set up to listen to outputChannel1 and outputChannel2
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
Message Routing is used in systems where messages need to be processed by different services based on their type, such as routing customer support tickets to the appropriate department.

### Message Transformation

Message Transformation involves altering or enriching messages as they pass through intermediary components before reaching the final consumer. This pattern is essential for adapting messages to different formats or adding additional data.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Format Conversion:** Converts messages to required formats.
- **Data Enrichment:** Adds additional information to messages.
- **Intermediary Processing:** Processes messages in transit.

**Java Example Using Apache Camel:**

```java
import org.apache.camel.CamelContext;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultCamelContext;

public class MessageTransformationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
        context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("direct:start")
                    .transform(body().prepend("Transformed: "))
                    .to("stream:out");
            }
        });

        context.start();
        context.createProducerTemplate().sendBody("direct:start", "Original Message");
        context.stop();
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
Message Transformation is crucial in integration scenarios where different systems use varying data formats, such as converting XML to JSON.

### Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)

Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) are specialized queues used to handle messages that cannot be processed successfully. They ensure that problematic messages are isolated for further analysis, preventing them from blocking the main processing flow.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Error Handling:** Captures unprocessable messages.
- **Isolation:** Prevents problematic messages from affecting the main queue.
- **Analysis and Debugging:** Facilitates troubleshooting and resolution.

**Java Example Using RabbitMQ:**

```java
import com.rabbitmq.client.*;

public class DeadLetterQueueExample {
    private final static String QUEUE_NAME = "mainQueue";
    private final static String DLQ_NAME = "deadLetterQueue";

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
        factory.setHost("localhost");
        try (Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
             Channel channel = connection.createChannel()) {

            // Declare main queue with DLQ settings
            channel.queueDeclare(QUEUE_NAME, true, false, false, Map.of("x-dead-letter-exchange", "", "x-dead-letter-routing-key", DLQ_NAME));
            channel.queueDeclare(DLQ_NAME, true, false, false, null);

            // Simulate message processing failure
            channel.basicPublish("", QUEUE_NAME, null, "Test Message".getBytes());
            channel.basicConsume(QUEUE_NAME, false, (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
                System.out.println("Received: " + new String(delivery.getBody()));
                channel.basicNack(delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false, false); // Reject message
            }, consumerTag -> {});

            // Consume from DLQ
            channel.basicConsume(DLQ_NAME, true, (consumerTag, delivery) -> {
                System.out.println("DLQ Received: " + new String(delivery.getBody()));
            }, consumerTag -> {});
        }
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
DLQs are essential in financial transaction systems to ensure that failed transactions are logged and reviewed without disrupting the main processing flow.

### Chaining and Orchestration

Chaining and Orchestration involve linking multiple messaging steps to accomplish complex workflows and business processes. This pattern is crucial for coordinating multiple services and ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct sequence.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Sequential Processing:** Executes tasks in a defined order.
- **Workflow Management:** Manages complex business processes.
- **Service Coordination:** Coordinates interactions between multiple services.

**Java Example Using Apache Camel:**

```java
import org.apache.camel.CamelContext;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;
import org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultCamelContext;

public class ChainingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
        context.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() {
                from("direct:start")
                    .to("bean:stepOne")
                    .to("bean:stepTwo")
                    .to("bean:stepThree")
                    .to("stream:out");
            }
        });

        context.start();
        context.createProducerTemplate().sendBody("direct:start", "Start Process");
        context.stop();
    }
}
```

**Real-World Application:**
Chaining and Orchestration are used in order fulfillment systems where multiple steps, such as inventory check, payment processing, and shipping, need to be coordinated.
