## 3.1.3 Use Cases for Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern that records all changes to an application's state as a sequence of events. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where understanding the history of state changes is crucial. In this section, we will explore various use cases where Event Sourcing shines, providing practical insights and examples to illustrate its application.

### Complex Domain Models

In applications with complex domain models, capturing every state change as an event allows for a detailed history that can be invaluable for debugging, auditing, and understanding system behavior. Event Sourcing is ideal for domains where the business logic is intricate and evolves over time. 

**Example:**

Consider a healthcare system that manages patient records. Each patient's medical history is a complex domain model involving numerous interactions, treatments, and updates. By using Event Sourcing, every change to a patient's record is stored as an event, providing a comprehensive audit trail that can be reviewed to understand the patient's treatment journey.

### Financial Systems

Financial systems, such as banking or trading platforms, require precise tracking of transactions and changes. Event Sourcing ensures that every transaction is recorded immutably, allowing for accurate reconstruction of account states at any point in time.

**Example:**

In a banking application, each deposit, withdrawal, or transfer is recorded as an event. This approach not only facilitates accurate balance calculations but also supports rollback capabilities and fraud detection by analyzing the sequence of transactions.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private List<Event> changes = new ArrayList<>();

    public void deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
        applyChange(new MoneyDeposited(amount));
    }

    public void withdraw(BigDecimal amount) {
        applyChange(new MoneyWithdrawn(amount));
    }

    private void applyChange(Event event) {
        changes.add(event);
        // Apply the event to the current state
    }
}
```

### Audit and Compliance

Industries with stringent audit and compliance requirements benefit from Event Sourcing's immutable event log. This log provides a reliable source of truth for regulatory audits and compliance checks.

**Example:**

In the insurance industry, every policy change, claim submission, and adjustment is recorded as an event. This ensures that auditors can trace the lifecycle of any policy or claim, verifying compliance with industry regulations.

### Collaborative Applications

Collaborative tools and systems, such as document editing platforms or project management software, rely on understanding the sequence of user actions to provide a seamless user experience.

**Example:**

In a collaborative document editor, each user's action (e.g., text insertion, deletion) is captured as an event. This allows the system to replay actions to resolve conflicts, merge changes, and provide a consistent view to all users.

### Real-Time Analytics

Event Sourcing supports real-time analytics by providing a continuous stream of events that can be processed and analyzed. This is particularly useful in applications that require immediate insights from data.

**Example:**

In a retail analytics platform, each customer interaction (e.g., product view, purchase) is recorded as an event. These events can be processed in real-time to generate insights, such as popular products or customer behavior trends.

```java
public class EventProcessor {
    public void processEvent(Event event) {
        // Process event for real-time analytics
    }
}
```

### Microservices Architectures

In microservices architectures, Event Sourcing facilitates communication and state management across distributed services. By storing state changes as events, services can remain decoupled while sharing a consistent view of the system's state.

**Example:**

In an e-commerce platform, different services (e.g., inventory, order processing, shipping) can subscribe to events related to order creation and updates. This allows each service to react to changes independently, maintaining a cohesive system without tight coupling.

### IoT Systems

IoT systems generate vast amounts of data from numerous devices. Event Sourcing can manage this data effectively, ensuring reliable state tracking and processing.

**Example:**

In a smart home system, each sensor reading (e.g., temperature, humidity) is recorded as an event. This allows for accurate state reconstruction and analysis, enabling features like trend prediction and anomaly detection.

### Case Studies

#### Real-World Example: Banking Application

A leading bank implemented Event Sourcing to manage its transaction processing system. By recording each transaction as an event, the bank achieved greater transparency and accuracy in its financial reporting. The immutable event log also facilitated compliance with regulatory requirements, providing auditors with a clear view of all financial activities.

#### Hypothetical Scenario: Collaborative Design Tool

Imagine a design tool used by teams to collaborate on graphic projects. By implementing Event Sourcing, the tool captures every design change as an event. This allows team members to review the design history, undo changes, and merge contributions seamlessly, enhancing collaboration and productivity.

### Conclusion

Event Sourcing is a versatile pattern that offers significant benefits across various domains. From complex domain models to real-time analytics, its ability to capture a detailed history of state changes makes it an invaluable tool for building robust, transparent, and scalable systems. By understanding and leveraging these use cases, developers can harness the full potential of Event Sourcing to create innovative solutions that meet the demands of modern applications.
