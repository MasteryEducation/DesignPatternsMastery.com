## 4.2.1 Designing Command Models

In the realm of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), designing command models is a crucial step that focuses on handling operations that modify the system's state. This section delves into the responsibilities of command models, how to effectively model commands, encapsulate business logic, manage command handling workflows, integrate with event stores, and optimize command performance. We'll also provide a practical example to illustrate these concepts in action.

### Defining Command Responsibilities

At the heart of CQRS, the command model is responsible for all operations that alter the state of the system. It encapsulates business logic and validations, ensuring that only valid and authorized changes are made. Commands are distinct from queries, which are responsible for retrieving data without modifying it.

Commands in CQRS are designed to:

- **Encapsulate Business Logic:** Commands ensure that all business rules and validations are applied before any state change occurs.
- **Modify System State:** They represent actions that lead to a change in the system's state, such as creating, updating, or deleting data.
- **Ensure Data Integrity:** By enforcing validation rules and business logic, commands maintain the integrity of the system's data.

### Modeling Commands

#### Command Objects

Commands are structured as objects that represent specific actions or intentions. Each command object encapsulates the data required to perform a particular action. For example, a `CreateOrderCommand` might include fields such as `orderId`, `customerId`, and `orderDetails`.

```java
public class CreateOrderCommand {
    private final String orderId;
    private final String customerId;
    private final List<OrderItem> orderItems;

    public CreateOrderCommand(String orderId, String customerId, List<OrderItem> orderItems) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.orderItems = orderItems;
    }

    // Getters and other methods
}
```

#### Naming Conventions

Clear and descriptive naming conventions are essential for commands to reflect their purpose and action. Commands should be named using verbs that indicate the action being performed, such as `PlaceOrder`, `CancelOrder`, or `UpdateCustomerDetails`. This clarity helps developers understand the intent of each command at a glance.

### Encapsulating Business Logic

#### Validation Rules

Validation rules are implemented within command handlers to ensure data integrity. These rules check the validity of the command's data before any state changes occur. For instance, a `PlaceOrderCommand` might validate that the order items are not empty and that the customer exists.

```java
public class PlaceOrderCommandHandler {
    public void handle(PlaceOrderCommand command) {
        validate(command);
        // Proceed with handling the command
    }

    private void validate(PlaceOrderCommand command) {
        if (command.getOrderItems().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Order must contain at least one item.");
        }
        // Additional validation logic
    }
}
```

#### Business Rules Enforcement

Business rules are enforced within the command model to prevent unauthorized or invalid state changes. These rules ensure that only permissible actions are executed, maintaining the system's integrity and compliance with business policies.

### Command Handling Workflow

#### Command Handlers

Command handlers are responsible for processing commands and executing the necessary state changes. They act as the intermediary between the command objects and the domain model, applying business logic and validations.

```java
public class CommandHandler {
    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;

    public CommandHandler(OrderRepository orderRepository) {
        this.orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public void handle(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        // Validate and process the command
        Order order = new Order(command.getOrderId(), command.getCustomerId(), command.getOrderItems());
        orderRepository.save(order);
    }
}
```

#### Transaction Management

Transaction management within command handlers ensures atomicity and consistency. Commands are often executed within a transactional context to guarantee that all state changes are applied together or not at all, preserving the system's consistency.

### Integration with Event Stores

#### Persisting State Changes

State changes resulting from commands are persisted as events in the event store. This approach not only records the changes but also enables event sourcing, where the current state can be reconstructed by replaying past events.

```java
public class OrderService {
    private final EventStore eventStore;

    public void handle(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        // Process command and generate events
        OrderCreatedEvent event = new OrderCreatedEvent(command.getOrderId(), command.getCustomerId(), command.getOrderItems());
        eventStore.save(event);
    }
}
```

### Error Handling in Commands

#### Replying to Failures

Handling and communicating command failures is crucial to ensure that consumers are aware of issues. Strategies include returning error messages, logging failures, and implementing retry mechanisms.

```java
public class CommandHandler {
    public void handle(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        try {
            // Process command
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Log and communicate failure
            System.err.println("Failed to process command: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Optimizing Command Performance

#### Asynchronous Command Handling

Asynchronous command handling can improve responsiveness by decoupling command processing from the request-response cycle. This approach is beneficial for long-running operations or when immediate feedback is not required.

```java
public class AsyncCommandHandler {
    private final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

    public void handleAsync(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        executorService.submit(() -> {
            // Process command asynchronously
        });
    }
}
```

### Example Implementation

Let's walk through a step-by-step example of designing a command model for a sample e-commerce application. We'll illustrate the creation of command objects, handlers, and integration with the event store.

#### Step 1: Define Command Objects

```java
public class AddProductToCartCommand {
    private final String cartId;
    private final String productId;
    private final int quantity;

    public AddProductToCartCommand(String cartId, String productId, int quantity) {
        this.cartId = cartId;
        this.productId = productId;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    // Getters
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Command Handler

```java
public class AddProductToCartHandler {
    private final CartRepository cartRepository;
    private final EventStore eventStore;

    public AddProductToCartHandler(CartRepository cartRepository, EventStore eventStore) {
        this.cartRepository = cartRepository;
        this.eventStore = eventStore;
    }

    public void handle(AddProductToCartCommand command) {
        // Validate command
        Cart cart = cartRepository.findById(command.getCartId());
        if (cart == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cart not found.");
        }

        // Update cart and persist event
        cart.addProduct(command.getProductId(), command.getQuantity());
        eventStore.save(new ProductAddedToCartEvent(command.getCartId(), command.getProductId(), command.getQuantity()));
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Integrate with Event Store

```java
public class EventStore {
    public void save(Event event) {
        // Persist event
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to design a command model that handles adding products to a shopping cart, ensuring validation, state changes, and event persistence.

### Conclusion

Designing command models in CQRS involves careful consideration of command responsibilities, modeling, business logic encapsulation, and integration with event stores. By following best practices and leveraging the power of commands, developers can create robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.
