## 12.2.1 Versioning Schemas

In the dynamic world of event-driven architectures (EDA), managing schema evolution is crucial to ensure system robustness and flexibility. As systems evolve, so do the data structures they rely on. This section delves into effective strategies for versioning schemas, ensuring that changes are manageable and backward-compatible, and that systems remain reliable and scalable.

### Adopt Semantic Versioning

Semantic versioning is a versioning scheme that conveys meaning about the underlying changes with each new release. It uses a three-part version number: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Here's how it applies to schema versioning:

- **MAJOR version**: Incremented when there are incompatible changes that might break existing consumers. For example, removing a required field or changing its type.
- **MINOR version**: Incremented when new, backward-compatible functionality is added. For instance, adding an optional field.
- **PATCH version**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes that do not affect the schema's structure.

Using semantic versioning helps consumers understand the impact of changes at a glance and plan their upgrades accordingly.

### Clearly Separate Major and Minor Changes

Distinguishing between major and minor changes is essential for maintaining compatibility and minimizing disruptions. Major changes require careful planning and communication, as they can break existing integrations. Minor changes, on the other hand, should be designed to be non-disruptive, allowing consumers to adopt them at their own pace.

#### Example in Java

Consider a Java class representing an event schema:

```java
public class UserEvent {
    private String userId; // Required field
    private String userName; // Required field
    private String email; // Optional field

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

- **Major Change**: Removing `userName` would be a major change, requiring a new major version.
- **Minor Change**: Adding a new optional field, such as `phoneNumber`, would be a minor change.

### Maintain Multiple Schema Versions

Supporting multiple schema versions concurrently is vital in a distributed system where consumers may upgrade at different times. This approach ensures that consumers can continue to process events without disruption while they transition to newer versions.

#### Practical Example

Imagine a system where events are published to a Kafka topic. You can maintain multiple versions by using different topics or by embedding version information in the event payloads.

```java
public class UserEventV1 {
    private String userId;
    private String userName;
    // V1 specific fields
}

public class UserEventV2 {
    private String userId;
    private String userName;
    private String phoneNumber; // New field in V2
    // V2 specific fields
}
```

### Automate Versioning Processes

Automation reduces the risk of human error and ensures consistency in versioning. Tools like Apache Avro, Protobuf, or JSON Schema can be used to define schemas programmatically, and scripts can automate the versioning process.

#### Example Automation Script

A simple script to automate schema versioning might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

increment_version() {
    local version=$1
    local change_type=$2

    IFS='.' read -r -a version_parts <<< "$version"

    case $change_type in
        major)
            ((version_parts[0]++))
            version_parts[1]=0
            version_parts[2]=0
            ;;
        minor)
            ((version_parts[1]++))
            version_parts[2]=0
            ;;
        patch)
            ((version_parts[2]++))
            ;;
    esac

    echo "${version_parts[0]}.${version_parts[1]}.${version_parts[2]}"
}

current_version="1.0.0"
new_version=$(increment_version $current_version "minor")
echo "New version: $new_version"
```

### Include Version Identifiers in Events

Embedding version identifiers within event payloads allows consumers to process events according to their supported schema versions. This practice ensures that consumers can handle different versions gracefully.

#### Java Example

```java
public class VersionedEvent {
    private String version; // e.g., "1.0.0"
    private String payload;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

### Deprecate Old Versions Gradually

Deprecating old schema versions should be a phased process, providing ample time for consumers to upgrade. This approach minimizes disruptions and ensures a smooth transition.

#### Deprecation Strategy

1. **Announce Deprecation**: Communicate the deprecation plan well in advance.
2. **Monitor Usage**: Use monitoring tools to track the adoption of new versions.
3. **Provide Support**: Offer support and resources to assist consumers in upgrading.
4. **Retire Old Versions**: Once usage drops below a certain threshold, retire the old versions.

### Provide Clear Migration Paths

Offering detailed migration guides and tools is essential for assisting consumers in transitioning to new schema versions smoothly. These resources should include:

- **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation outlining the changes and their impact.
- **Code Samples**: Examples demonstrating how to adapt to the new schema.
- **Automated Tools**: Scripts or tools that automate parts of the migration process.

### Monitor Usage of Schema Versions

Monitoring the usage of different schema versions helps identify when old versions can be safely retired. Tools like Prometheus or Grafana can be used to track metrics and visualize adoption trends.

#### Example Monitoring Setup

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'schema_version_usage'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

### Conclusion

Versioning schemas in event-driven architectures is a critical practice that ensures system flexibility and reliability. By adopting semantic versioning, maintaining multiple schema versions, and providing clear migration paths, organizations can manage schema evolution effectively. Automation and monitoring further enhance these processes, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring smooth transitions.
