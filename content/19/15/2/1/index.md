## 15.2.1 Strangler Pattern

The Strangler Pattern is a strategic approach for incrementally migrating a monolithic application to microservices. This pattern allows organizations to gradually replace parts of a monolithic system with new microservices, minimizing risk and disruption while modernizing their architecture. Inspired by the way a strangler fig plant grows around a tree, eventually replacing it, this pattern provides a controlled and systematic method for transforming legacy systems.

### Defining the Strangler Pattern

The Strangler Pattern is a migration strategy that involves incrementally replacing parts of a monolithic application with microservices. This approach allows for a gradual transition, enabling teams to modernize their systems without the need for a complete rewrite or a risky "big bang" deployment. By focusing on small, manageable pieces of functionality, the Strangler Pattern reduces complexity and risk, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation.

### Start with a Core Functionality

The first step in implementing the Strangler Pattern is to identify a core functionality within the monolith that can be easily extracted and developed as a standalone microservice. This functionality should be well-defined, with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies on other parts of the system. By starting with a core functionality, you create a foundation for further migration efforts.

#### Example: Extracting a User Authentication Service

Consider a monolithic e-commerce application with a user authentication module. This module can be a prime candidate for extraction due to its well-defined scope and critical importance. By developing a new authentication microservice, you can begin the migration process while ensuring that this essential functionality is modernized and scalable.

### Redirect Traffic Gradually

Once a core functionality has been extracted and developed as a microservice, the next step is to gradually redirect traffic from the monolith to the new service. This can be achieved through techniques such as feature toggles, API gateways, or routing rules that allow you to control the flow of requests.

#### Implementing Traffic Redirection

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class AuthenticationController {

    private final AuthenticationService authenticationService;

    public AuthenticationController(AuthenticationService authenticationService) {
        this.authenticationService = authenticationService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/authenticate")
    public ResponseEntity<String> authenticateUser() {
        // Redirect traffic to the new authentication microservice
        return authenticationService.authenticate();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `AuthenticationController` redirects authentication requests to the new `AuthenticationService`, allowing for a gradual transition without disrupting existing users.

### Iterate and Expand

With the initial microservice in place, the next step is to iteratively identify and migrate additional functionalities from the monolith. This process involves continuously evaluating the monolith to determine which components can be extracted and developed as independent services.

#### Expanding the Migration

- **Identify Candidates:** Look for functionalities with clear boundaries and minimal dependencies.
- **Develop Microservices:** Build new services for each identified functionality, ensuring they are well-encapsulated.
- **Redirect Traffic:** Gradually shift traffic to the new services, monitoring performance and reliability.

### Ensure Encapsulation

A critical aspect of the Strangler Pattern is ensuring that each migrated microservice is well-encapsulated. This means that the service should manage its own data and responsibilities, without tightly coupling with other services or the remaining monolith. Encapsulation promotes independence and resilience, allowing services to evolve without impacting others.

#### Best Practices for Encapsulation

- **Data Ownership:** Each microservice should have its own database or data store, ensuring data independence.
- **Clear Interfaces:** Define clear and stable interfaces for communication between services.
- **Loose Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between services to reduce the risk of cascading failures.

### Maintain Monolith Support

During the migration process, it's essential to maintain support for the monolith. This ensures that un-migrated functionalities continue to operate reliably while new services are integrated. Maintaining monolith support involves regular updates, monitoring, and testing to ensure stability.

### Monitor and Optimize Performance

Continuous monitoring and optimization are crucial for ensuring the performance and reliability of both the monolith and the new microservices. This involves using monitoring tools and techniques to track key metrics, identify bottlenecks, and make necessary adjustments.

#### Monitoring Tools and Techniques

- **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to track service interactions and identify issues.
- **Metrics:** Use metrics to monitor performance, such as response times and error rates.
- **Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing to understand the flow of requests across services.

### Plan for Final Monolith Decommission

As the migration progresses and more functionalities are moved to microservices, it's important to develop a clear plan for decommissioning the monolith. This involves ensuring that all functionalities have been successfully migrated, testing the new architecture, and gradually phasing out the monolith.

#### Steps for Decommissioning

1. **Complete Migration:** Ensure all functionalities are migrated and tested.
2. **Validate New Architecture:** Conduct thorough testing to validate the new microservices architecture.
3. **Phase Out the Monolith:** Gradually reduce reliance on the monolith, eventually decommissioning it entirely.

### Conclusion

The Strangler Pattern offers a practical and effective approach for migrating monolithic applications to microservices. By focusing on incremental changes and gradual transitions, this pattern minimizes risk and disruption, allowing organizations to modernize their systems while maintaining stability and performance. Through careful planning, encapsulation, and monitoring, the Strangler Pattern enables a smooth and successful migration to a microservices architecture.
