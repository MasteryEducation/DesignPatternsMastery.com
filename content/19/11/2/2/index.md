## 11.2.2 Correlation IDs and Context Propagation

In the realm of microservices, where a single user request can traverse multiple services, maintaining traceability and understanding the flow of requests becomes crucial. This is where **Correlation IDs** and **Context Propagation** come into play. These concepts are foundational to achieving effective observability, allowing developers to trace requests across distributed systems, debug issues efficiently, and ensure seamless service interactions.

### Defining Correlation IDs

**Correlation IDs** are unique identifiers attached to each request as it enters a system. They serve as a thread that weaves through the various microservices involved in processing a request, enabling developers to trace the request's journey from start to finish. By using correlation IDs, teams can easily correlate logs, metrics, and traces, providing a comprehensive view of the request's lifecycle.

#### Key Benefits of Correlation IDs:
- **Enhanced Traceability:** Track the flow of requests across services.
- **Simplified Debugging:** Quickly identify where issues occur in the request path.
- **Improved Observability:** Correlate logs and traces for a unified view.

### Implementing Correlation ID Generation

To effectively use correlation IDs, they must be generated at the entry points of your system, such as API gateways or load balancers. This ensures that every incoming request is assigned a unique identifier.

#### Example in Java using Spring Boot:

```java
import org.springframework.web.filter.OncePerRequestFilter;

import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.UUID;

public class CorrelationIdFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

    private static final String CORRELATION_ID_HEADER = "X-Correlation-ID";

    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
            throws ServletException, IOException {

        String correlationId = request.getHeader(CORRELATION_ID_HEADER);
        if (correlationId == null) {
            correlationId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        }

        response.setHeader(CORRELATION_ID_HEADER, correlationId);
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
```

In this example, a filter checks for the presence of a correlation ID in the request header. If absent, it generates a new UUID and attaches it to the response header, ensuring that all subsequent services can access this ID.

### Propagating Correlation IDs Across Services

Once a correlation ID is generated, it must be propagated through all service interactions to maintain trace continuity. This is typically done by including the correlation ID in request headers.

#### Example of Propagation in Java:

```java
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;

public class ServiceClient {

    private RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    public String callAnotherService(String correlationId) {
        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.set("X-Correlation-ID", correlationId);

        HttpEntity<String> entity = new HttpEntity<>(headers);
        ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.exchange(
                "http://another-service/api/resource",
                HttpMethod.GET,
                entity,
                String.class
        );

        return response.getBody();
    }
}
```

In this snippet, the `ServiceClient` class demonstrates how to include the correlation ID in the headers when making a call to another service, ensuring the ID is passed along the request chain.

### Modifying Service Code for Correlation

To leverage correlation IDs effectively, microservice code must be adapted to extract and utilize these IDs. This involves ensuring that correlation IDs are included in logs, metrics, and traces.

#### Logging with Correlation IDs:

```java
import org.slf4j.MDC;

public class LoggingService {

    public void logRequest(String correlationId, String message) {
        MDC.put("correlationId", correlationId);
        logger.info("Processing request: {}", message);
        MDC.clear();
    }
}
```

Using the Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC) in SLF4J, you can include the correlation ID in log entries, making it easier to trace logs related to a specific request.

### Use Middleware for Automatic Propagation

To reduce manual code modifications, middleware or interceptors can be employed to automate the extraction and forwarding of correlation IDs. This approach ensures consistency and minimizes the risk of human error.

#### Example with Spring Interceptors:

```java
import org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerInterceptor;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class CorrelationIdInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) {
        String correlationId = request.getHeader("X-Correlation-ID");
        if (correlationId == null) {
            correlationId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        }
        response.setHeader("X-Correlation-ID", correlationId);
        return true;
    }
}
```

By using an interceptor, you can automatically handle correlation ID propagation without modifying each service method.

### Ensure Consistent Logging Practices

Including correlation IDs in all log entries is crucial for seamless correlation between logs from different services involved in the same request. This practice enables developers to trace the entire request path across the system.

### Implement Correlation in Tracing Systems

Integrating correlation IDs with distributed tracing systems, such as OpenTelemetry, ensures that trace spans across services are correctly linked to the original request. This integration provides a holistic view of request flows and performance bottlenecks.

#### Example with OpenTelemetry:

```java
import io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Tracer;
import io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Span;

public class TracingService {

    private final Tracer tracer;

    public TracingService(Tracer tracer) {
        this.tracer = tracer;
    }

    public void traceRequest(String correlationId) {
        Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("processRequest")
                .setAttribute("correlationId", correlationId)
                .startSpan();

        try {
            // Process request
        } finally {
            span.end();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the correlation ID is added as an attribute to the trace span, ensuring it is part of the trace data.

### Monitor and Enforce Correlation ID Usage

Monitoring the usage of correlation IDs and enforcing their inclusion in all service communications and observability data is essential to maintain comprehensive traceability. Regular audits and automated checks can help ensure compliance with this practice.

### Conclusion

Correlation IDs and context propagation are vital components of a robust observability strategy in microservices architectures. By implementing these practices, organizations can achieve greater traceability, simplify debugging, and enhance the overall reliability of their systems. As you integrate these concepts into your microservices, remember to leverage automation tools and frameworks to streamline the process and maintain consistency across your services.
