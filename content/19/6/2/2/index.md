## 6.2.2 Header and Media Type Versioning

In the realm of API design, versioning is a critical aspect that ensures backward compatibility and smooth evolution of services. Among the various strategies, header and media type versioning stand out for their ability to provide flexibility and maintain a clean API interface. This section delves into these strategies, offering insights into their implementation and best practices.

### Header-Based Versioning

Header-based versioning involves specifying the API version within the HTTP headers, typically using a custom header like `Accept-Version`. This approach separates versioning information from the URL, keeping the endpoint paths clean and consistent.

#### Defining Header-Based Versioning

In header-based versioning, clients specify the desired API version using a header. For example:

```
Accept-Version: v1
```

This method allows the server to determine the appropriate version of the API to serve based on the request headers, offering a clean separation between the API's URL structure and its versioning scheme.

#### Implementing Header Parsing

To implement header-based versioning, the server must be capable of parsing the `Accept-Version` header and routing the request to the appropriate version of the API. Here's a simple Java example using Spring Boot:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/resource")
public class ResourceController {

    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> getResource(@RequestHeader(value = "Accept-Version", defaultValue = "v1") String version) {
        switch (version) {
            case "v1":
                return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource version 1");
            case "v2":
                return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource version 2");
            default:
                return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body("Version not supported");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `getResource` method checks the `Accept-Version` header and returns the appropriate version of the resource. If the version is not supported, it returns a 404 error.

### Media Type Versioning

Media type versioning embeds version information within the `Content-Type` or `Accept` headers, using a custom media type format. This approach leverages HTTP content negotiation to allow clients to request specific versions dynamically.

#### Defining Media Type Versioning

In media type versioning, the API version is part of the media type. For example:

```
Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json
```

This format specifies both the version (`v1`) and the expected content type (`json`), enabling precise control over the API's response format.

#### Facilitating Content Negotiation

Media type versioning utilizes HTTP's content negotiation capabilities, allowing clients to specify the desired version and format. The server must parse the `Accept` header to determine the appropriate response. Here's an example implementation:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/resource")
public class ResourceController {

    @GetMapping(produces = {"application/vnd.myapi.v1+json", "application/vnd.myapi.v2+json"})
    public ResponseEntity<String> getResource(@RequestHeader(value = "Accept") String acceptHeader) {
        if (acceptHeader.contains("vnd.myapi.v1+json")) {
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource version 1");
        } else if (acceptHeader.contains("vnd.myapi.v2+json")) {
            return ResponseEntity.ok("Resource version 2");
        } else {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_ACCEPTABLE).body("Version not supported");
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to parse the `Accept` header and return the appropriate version of the resource.

### Encapsulating Version Logic

To maintain a clean codebase, it's essential to encapsulate version-specific logic. This can be achieved by using versioned service classes or controllers, ensuring that each version's logic is isolated and easy to manage.

```java
public interface ResourceService {
    String getResource();
}

public class ResourceServiceV1 implements ResourceService {
    @Override
    public String getResource() {
        return "Resource version 1";
    }
}

public class ResourceServiceV2 implements ResourceService {
    @Override
    public String getResource() {
        return "Resource version 2";
    }
}
```

By encapsulating version logic in separate classes, you can easily extend and maintain different versions without cluttering the main controller logic.

### Ensuring Flexibility and Extensibility

Header and media type versioning offer significant flexibility, allowing for granular control over API versions. This flexibility facilitates future extensions and ensures that new versions can be introduced without disrupting existing clients.

#### Handling Default Versions

When clients do not specify a version, it's crucial to have a default version strategy. This ensures consistent behavior and prevents ambiguity. For example, the server can default to the latest stable version or the first version:

```java
@GetMapping
public ResponseEntity<String> getResource(@RequestHeader(value = "Accept-Version", defaultValue = "v1") String version) {
    // Default to version 1 if no version is specified
}
```

### Documenting Versioning Approach

Thorough documentation of the versioning strategy is essential for client adoption. Documentation should include:

- **Versioning Scheme:** Clearly explain how versions are specified in headers.
- **Supported Versions:** List all supported versions and their features.
- **Default Version Behavior:** Describe what happens when no version is specified.
- **Examples:** Provide examples of requests and responses for each version.

### Real-World Scenario

Consider a scenario where a company provides a weather API. Initially, the API only returns temperature data. Later, they introduce a new version that includes humidity and wind speed. Using media type versioning, clients can request the new version without affecting those who rely on the original version.

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use semantic versioning to convey changes clearly.
  - Keep versioning logic isolated to simplify maintenance.
  - Ensure backward compatibility whenever possible.

- **Common Pitfalls:**
  - Overcomplicating versioning logic, leading to maintenance challenges.
  - Failing to document versioning strategies, causing client confusion.
  - Ignoring default version handling, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Conclusion

Header and media type versioning are powerful strategies for managing API evolution. By leveraging HTTP headers and content negotiation, these approaches provide flexibility and maintainability, ensuring that APIs can evolve without disrupting existing clients. Implementing these strategies requires careful planning, encapsulation of version-specific logic, and thorough documentation to guide clients effectively.
