## 7.6.3 Global vs. Local Transactions

In the realm of microservices, managing transactions effectively is crucial to ensuring data consistency and system reliability. This section delves into the concepts of global and local transactions, comparing their characteristics, use cases, and implementation strategies. We will explore how to leverage distributed transaction protocols and patterns like Sagas to maintain consistency across services while optimizing for performance and fault tolerance.

### Defining Global and Local Transactions

**Global Transactions** are transactions that span multiple services or databases. They require coordination across different systems to ensure that all parts of the transaction are completed successfully. If any part fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to maintain consistency.

**Local Transactions**, on the other hand, are confined to a single service or database. They are simpler to manage since they involve only one system, and they can often be completed more quickly than global transactions.

### Compare Characteristics

#### Global Transactions

- **Consistency:** Provide strong consistency by ensuring that all involved services agree on the transaction outcome.
- **Complexity:** Require complex coordination mechanisms, such as Two-Phase Commit (2PC), to manage distributed state.
- **Performance:** Can introduce latency due to the need for coordination and potential rollbacks.
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for critical operations where data consistency is paramount, such as financial transactions.

#### Local Transactions

- **Consistency:** Typically offer eventual consistency, which may be sufficient for many use cases.
- **Complexity:** Simpler to implement and manage, as they do not require coordination across services.
- **Performance:** Generally faster and more efficient, as they avoid the overhead of distributed coordination.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for high-performance operations where some degree of eventual consistency is acceptable, such as user profile updates.

### Assess Use Cases

When deciding between global and local transactions, consider the following:

- **Criticality of Consistency:** Use global transactions for operations where strong consistency is non-negotiable.
- **Performance Requirements:** Opt for local transactions when performance and responsiveness are prioritized over immediate consistency.
- **System Complexity:** Evaluate the complexity and overhead introduced by global transactions and weigh it against the benefits of strong consistency.

### Implement Distributed Transaction Protocols

One common protocol for managing global transactions is the **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**. It involves two main phases:

1. **Prepare Phase:** Each participating service prepares to commit and reports its readiness.
2. **Commit Phase:** Once all services are ready, the transaction coordinator instructs them to commit. If any service cannot commit, the transaction is aborted.

Here's a simplified Java example illustrating a 2PC implementation:

```java
public class TwoPhaseCommit {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TransactionCoordinator coordinator = new TransactionCoordinator();
        ServiceA serviceA = new ServiceA();
        ServiceB serviceB = new ServiceB();

        coordinator.addParticipant(serviceA);
        coordinator.addParticipant(serviceB);

        if (coordinator.prepare()) {
            coordinator.commit();
        } else {
            coordinator.rollback();
        }
    }
}

class TransactionCoordinator {
    private List<TransactionParticipant> participants = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addParticipant(TransactionParticipant participant) {
        participants.add(participant);
    }

    public boolean prepare() {
        for (TransactionParticipant participant : participants) {
            if (!participant.prepare()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public void commit() {
        for (TransactionParticipant participant : participants) {
            participant.commit();
        }
    }

    public void rollback() {
        for (TransactionParticipant participant : participants) {
            participant.rollback();
        }
    }
}

interface TransactionParticipant {
    boolean prepare();
    void commit();
    void rollback();
}

class ServiceA implements TransactionParticipant {
    public boolean prepare() {
        // Prepare logic
        return true;
    }

    public void commit() {
        // Commit logic
    }

    public void rollback() {
        // Rollback logic
    }
}

class ServiceB implements TransactionParticipant {
    public boolean prepare() {
        // Prepare logic
        return true;
    }

    public void commit() {
        // Commit logic
    }

    public void rollback() {
        // Rollback logic
    }
}
```

### Leverage Sagas for Global Transactions

The **Saga pattern** offers an alternative to 2PC by managing global consistency through a series of local transactions and compensating actions. Each service involved in a Saga performs its local transaction and, if necessary, triggers a compensating transaction to undo changes in case of failure.

#### Saga Example

Consider a travel booking system where booking a flight, hotel, and car rental are separate services. Each service completes its transaction independently, and compensating actions are defined to cancel bookings if any part of the Saga fails.

```java
public class TravelBookingSaga {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SagaCoordinator coordinator = new SagaCoordinator();
        coordinator.addStep(new FlightBookingService());
        coordinator.addStep(new HotelBookingService());
        coordinator.addStep(new CarRentalService());

        coordinator.executeSaga();
    }
}

class SagaCoordinator {
    private List<SagaStep> steps = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addStep(SagaStep step) {
        steps.add(step);
    }

    public void executeSaga() {
        for (SagaStep step : steps) {
            if (!step.execute()) {
                compensate();
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    private void compensate() {
        for (SagaStep step : steps) {
            step.compensate();
        }
    }
}

interface SagaStep {
    boolean execute();
    void compensate();
}

class FlightBookingService implements SagaStep {
    public boolean execute() {
        // Booking logic
        return true;
    }

    public void compensate() {
        // Cancellation logic
    }
}

class HotelBookingService implements SagaStep {
    public boolean execute() {
        // Booking logic
        return true;
    }

    public void compensate() {
        // Cancellation logic
    }
}

class CarRentalService implements SagaStep {
    public boolean execute() {
        // Booking logic
        return true;
    }

    public void compensate() {
        // Cancellation logic
    }
}
```

### Optimize for Performance

To optimize the performance of global transactions:

- **Minimize Coordination:** Reduce the number of services involved in global transactions to decrease coordination overhead.
- **Use Asynchronous Communication:** Leverage asynchronous messaging to decouple services and improve responsiveness.
- **Batch Operations:** Group multiple operations into a single transaction to reduce the frequency of coordination.

### Ensure Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is critical in global transactions to handle failures gracefully:

- **Implement Retries:** Use retry mechanisms to handle transient failures.
- **Design for Idempotency:** Ensure that operations can be safely retried without unintended side effects.
- **Monitor and Alert:** Continuously monitor transaction outcomes and set up alerts for failures.

### Provide Best Practices

- **Design for Scalability:** Architect your system to handle increasing loads without sacrificing consistency.
- **Balance Consistency and Availability:** Choose the right transaction management approach based on your application's consistency and availability needs.
- **Use the Right Tools:** Leverage frameworks and tools that support distributed transactions and Sagas, such as Spring Cloud Data Flow or Axon Framework.

### Conclusion

Understanding the trade-offs between global and local transactions is essential for designing scalable and reliable microservices. By carefully assessing use cases and leveraging appropriate patterns and protocols, you can achieve the right balance between consistency, performance, and complexity.
