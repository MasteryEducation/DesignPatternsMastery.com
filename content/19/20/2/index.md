## B.2 Acronyms and Abbreviations

In the world of microservices and software architecture, acronyms and abbreviations are ubiquitous. They serve as shorthand for complex concepts, tools, and practices that are integral to building scalable, resilient systems. Understanding these terms is crucial for any software engineer or architect working with microservices. This section provides a comprehensive guide to some of the most common acronyms and abbreviations you'll encounter in the field.

### API: Application Programming Interface

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs enable different software programs to communicate with each other, allowing developers to access certain functionalities of an application without having to understand its internal workings. In microservices architecture, APIs are the primary means of communication between services.

**Example:**

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class ProductController {

    @GetMapping("/products")
    public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
        // Logic to retrieve all products
    }

    @PostMapping("/products")
    public Product createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        // Logic to create a new product
    }
}
```

In this Java example, a RESTful API is defined using Spring Boot to manage products in a microservice.

### CI/CD: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the integration and deployment of code changes. CI involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository, while CD ensures that these changes are automatically deployed to production environments. Together, CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality and accelerate the delivery of software.

**Example:**

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean install

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - mvn test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
```

This GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment stages of a Java application.

### CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that separates the operations that read data (queries) from those that update data (commands). This separation allows for optimized data models and can improve performance and scalability in microservices.

**Example:**

```java
// Command
public class CreateOrderCommand {
    private String orderId;
    private List<OrderItem> items;
    // Getters and setters
}

// Query
public class OrderQuery {
    private String orderId;
    // Getters and setters
}
```

In this example, CQRS is used to separate the command for creating an order from the query for retrieving order details.

### DDD: Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the domain. It involves defining bounded contexts and using domain models to drive the design of software systems.

**Example:**

```java
@Entity
public class Customer {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    // Domain logic methods
}
```

Here, a `Customer` entity is part of a domain model, encapsulating business logic related to customer management.

### ELK: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

ELK is a popular stack used for logging and monitoring. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine, Logstash is a data processing pipeline, and Kibana is a visualization tool. Together, they provide powerful capabilities for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing log data in microservices environments.

**Example:**

```yaml
input {
  file {
    path => "/var/log/myapp/*.log"
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
  }
}
```

This Logstash configuration collects log files and sends them to Elasticsearch for indexing.

### JWT: JSON Web Token

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in microservices, allowing services to verify the identity of clients without needing to store session information.

**Example:**

```java
String jwt = Jwts.builder()
    .setSubject("user123")
    .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, "secretKey")
    .compact();
```

This Java snippet demonstrates creating a JWT with a subject claim using the JJWT library.

### mTLS: Mutual Transport Layer Security

Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is an extension of TLS that provides mutual authentication between client and server. In microservices, mTLS is used to ensure secure communication and verify the identities of both parties involved in the communication.

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

This Kubernetes configuration enforces mTLS for all services in a namespace using Istio.

### RBAC: Role-Based Access Control

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. In microservices, RBAC is used to enforce security policies and ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to access services.

**Example:**

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
public void deleteUser(Long userId) {
    // Logic to delete a user
}
```

In this Spring Security example, the `deleteUser` method is restricted to users with the `ADMIN` role.

### SLA: Service Level Agreement

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the expected level of service, including availability, performance, and other metrics. SLAs are critical in microservices to ensure that services meet the agreed-upon standards.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Service Availability: 99.9%
Response Time: < 200ms
Support: 24/7
```

This SLA outlines the expected availability, response time, and support for a service.

### SLO: Service Level Objective

A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a specific, measurable goal that a service must achieve to meet the terms of an SLA. SLOs are used to define the performance and reliability targets for microservices.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Error Rate: < 0.1%
Latency: < 100ms
```

These SLOs specify the maximum allowable error rate and latency for a service.

### SSO: Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. In microservices, SSO simplifies user management and enhances security by centralizing authentication.

**Example:**

```java
// Spring Security SSO configuration
@EnableOAuth2Sso
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    // SSO configuration details
}
```

This Spring Security configuration enables SSO using OAuth2.

### TTL: Time To Live

Time To Live (TTL) is a mechanism that limits the lifespan of data or resources. In microservices, TTL is often used to control the caching of data, ensuring that stale information is not served to clients.

**Example:**

```java
Cache<String, String> cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
    .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
    .build();
```

This Java example uses Google's Guava library to create a cache with a TTL of 10 minutes.
